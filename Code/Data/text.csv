I had agreed to meet I at his work-place.  He greeted me warmly and ushered me into a small office which had a glass front, looking out onto a large open-plan office.  I sat in a comfortable chair and faced I across his desk. There was no room to rearrange the furniture.  I swivelled on his chair and  played with his pen. On two occasions a colleague burst through the office door and needed I's attention.  I became flustered but I reassured him.  This was his work environment, I was the intruder.


Can you tell me a bit about yourself and your background?

I’m thirty.  I live at H and we use to live at Scaleby.  We farm at home.  I’ve been here all my life.  Worked here fourteen years.  High school, left school on the Wednesday started here on the Monday so it’s been quite a stretch. We  were closed for a year.  Myself I just enjoy all sorts.  Do plays, I love travelling round the country.  Reading.  Just generally like enjoyed myself.  Still at the age to do it, I’ve got no children, not married, so I can just bomb around and do what I want.

So your parents farm, do they?

 My parents farm at Scaleby.

And they’re still farming?

Well we lost all our stock to foot and mouth and today [EMPHASIS] believe it or not, the 1st of March, we’ve just finished our four month period yesterday [ cleaning after foot and mouth] so we can actually have stock on the farm today, so it’s arriving up tomorrow, and four wagon loads [LAUGHTER]

 Is it a mixed farm?

It is, yes.  There’s actually two farms.  My father is in partnership with the brothers but they’re all split up now, it’s an opportunity for them to go their own way.  So as I say, it’s a mixed farm, it’s got a little bit of everything on.

So obviously you’re in a farming related business, but you personally didn’t want to go into farming?

No, no.  I’ve got a brother C; he’s not interested in farming either.

You’ve got other brothers and sisters?

No, there is just the two of us.

And neither of you are interested in Farming so it’s just your parents?

Yes just my parents.

Do they worry about what’s going to happen?

Not really.  They’ve never been concerned.  The position at home has always been a strange one, because with their being a partnership, and with my grandparents still being in the partnership, its never sort of been perceived as being our farm, so the fact that neither of us wanted to follow on was like, oh well.  They’re quite happy about it really, and the way farming’s gone I think they were even more happy, we’ve decided to get away from it, particularly my brother.  I’ve sort of got back into it slightly; I’ve kept a hand in.

Once your parents retire, what’s going to happen to the farm then?

Once my parents retire the farm will be sold, that will be it. [PAUSE]   Retire to a nice little seaside bungalow somewhere [LAUGHTER].

You don’t have regrets about that?

No.  As I say, it’s not an interest that was ever there when I was a kid, so if it’s not there you can’t feed it, you can’t learn to be interested.

But you obviously have a lot of background knowledge?

Well yeh, you’re brought up with it.  It’s like, I suppose if your father was a racing driver, you would know everything about racing cars there was to know but it doesn’t mean you’re going to jump in a car and go for it.  It’s just inherent knowledge.

Did your parents ever speak about the 67/ 68 outbreak?

No. My parents, they were sort of teenagers really at that time, sort of early twenties.  My Grandmother use to talk about it a lot, she knew about it, and my Granddad as well on the other side of the family.  They were both quite well informed and well up on it.
Well it did, it broke my Grandad’s heart really. It wasn’t like this back then.

Were they affected by it?

No.  Round here it really only got as far as the Post-House hotel, it never pushed any further west of the county.

Did they make comparisons between then and now?

Just really [PAUSE]… they kept coming out with, it was never like this then, you know, bury them on the farm covered them in lime and be done with it.  So they never went any further into it really.  Even when we got taken out [culled] at home.  It wasn’t like this back then.

So what was your first memory of the recent outbreak?

Was in here.  It was about the Tuesday and word got through from Maff over the road there was a suspected case down in Essex.  Then we thought, oh well, that’s three hundred mile away, its going to be fine.  Then it gradually worked up the country and then come the Friday they linked it back to Longtown mart.  That was it, we were closed, the Friday.  The sale we’re having today was the last sale that we had, last year.

So you had a sale on the Friday?

We had a sale on the Friday and then that was it, they closed all the live stock marts.

Was that sale any different to what they normally are at that time of year?

Not really, no.

Were there any rumours or ripples?

Not really, no.  It’s funny because we’ve seen sort of two bits of this.  As I say, last year, that time, there wasn’t any real concern. Now this week, as particular people decided to do [PAUSE]…  there’s foot and mouth case suspected, now as soon as that was mentioned this [EMPHASIS]  week, even though there’s been about a dozen of those in the last three weeks, that never hit the headlines.  As soon as that was mentioned, everyone was nervy.  Lots of  phone calls.  The switchboard was inundated here wanting to know if we were open, had the rules changed.  Last year it was nothing, you know, until the marts were closed, then people realised this is going to be quite… Then the following week we were all called in here, a hundred of us, went onto half time, fifty percent pay.

That was immediate was it?

Immediate, yes, because we were working live on a very small commission basis here.

So was there a sense then that it might go on for a little while?

No.  We planned for ten weeks.  We sat down and did the books and planned for ten weeks.  We thought, well right, ten weeks half pay, we can survive on that and then if we get ok on ten weeks, we get another ten weeks, have another ten weeks, it was going to be half pay again and then once we started getting back into profit, we could claw back what pay you’d given up over the twenty weeks.  It was either , all or nothing situation, it was either take this or we’re  going to have to lay all of us off.  It was immediate.  It was within seven days of being closed down.  The second week, when it came round, Defra over the road struggling for staff as they were, came over and said, look, we’ve got positions for staff, have you got you any staff to give us.  It was great, we said, right, have the whole office, we need two core people in here and the rest you can have.  So we pushed everybody over to Defra.

So everyone was seconded?

Everyone was seconded to Defra.

On a full time basis?

On a full time basis, quite a lot of them and the ones that were left, M, myself, H down the corridor and ML, we did a two and a half day job share.  We all did two and a half days a week but two different jobs. ML and I shared one job, ML and H shared another job.  So I did Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday morning, ML would do Wednesday afternoon, Thursday, Friday.  They weren’t too keen about that over the road but as I said, this is the kind of people you get, it’s going to be fine; and it was fine.   

So in terms of you personally, you had gone down to half time, half pay, did you do anything else with the rest of the half time that you had left?

I went down to half time, we were just on that for basically a fortnight and then we were straight into the secondment.

So what was that like?

It was weird at first, but coming from farming stock, I know what the Ministry is like.  They are perceived as being absolute duck eggs in the farming community; it’s just paperwork, paperwork, paperwork. So we had a chat in here before we went over and said, look, people over there [PAUSE]… you’ve just got to basically go in and act confident with them.  Just go in, this is who I am, this is what I do, I’m in charge [PAUSE]… because quite a lot of us were taken over there as COs (Commanding Officer}.  Defra seconded quite a lot of their staff over from other areas.  So we just sat in here all of us, we said right, we’ve just got to go in, be confident; and we did.  Everyone just went in, and it was like, right, we’re here, we’re in charge, this is what we do.  It was a bit intimidating [LAUGHTER]  you didn’t know whether [PAUSE]   they might have only had a job for us for a fortnight, you could have been back on to half time here at any time [PAUSE], and that’s the option we still have.  Four over there now,  they shout to come back, but we don’t have the work for them to do at the moment. So we still have people seconded there. 

Do you know how long that’s likely to last?

We don’t.  Fortunately the ones that are left over there are in the finance department, so finance is one of the last things to wind down because there’s still wages to pay, still expenses to pay, still bills coming in, still expenses for hotels, so hopefully another three or four months.

So the period when you were down to skeleton staff quite early on in the outbreak, what was the bulk of your everyday work then?

At the start, it was really just chasing up old debt, chasing up debt that hadn’t been paid.  Because the way we work here it’s on a fortnight role and it’s really just chasing up debt that hadn’t been paid, but then after a fortnight, three weeks it was just polishing debts, you know, tidying up.

So you weren’t inundated with calls?

Well about the third or fourth week, maybe even more, we got involved in the voluntary cull [PAUSE].  They decided to base the voluntary cull in this [EMPHASIS] office, and they wanted a team of twenty people in here to ring all the farmers and say, look we’re ringing up for the voluntary cull, would you like to offer your sheep for cull.  It was like oh yes, no, oh yes no.

So presumably you’re ringing up people you know?

People we knew, customers.  I rang my parents up [PAUSE], you know, because our sheep went on the cull first, and I rang my parents up [EMPHASIS] and said this is how it is.  Because our sheep actually went on the 10th of April, the cattle went down on the 24th, so we sort of went through it twice at home, but you’re ringing people up in here who you see at the counter every day [PAUSE],  every day [EMPHASIS]   you’re saying, do you want to give up 600 sheep with lambs.  Oh heartbreaking.  More so for them and then you thought well it’s something that’s got to be done  [LONG PAUSE]   because there was a strong feeling that enough wasn’t being done and it had to be.  So we ran that for about five weeks in here.

So this is where  there’d been an IP[infected premises]  and they were taken out…

All the sheep within three kilometres.

  Right.

And was it voluntary?

It changed.  It changed so many times.  It started off it was voluntary, do you want to, and then you would get [PAUSE]  there was a lass called Katy M suppose to be running it… and then you’d get a call at four o clock on Thursday, it’s compulsory, so then it’s changed, it’s compulsory your sheep are [EMPHASIS] going and then maybe Saturday, Sunday, oh no it’s not, can’t get the legislation through.  It swung, tick, tock, we never knew.  Now they have said, it’s compulsory.  The Government have gone on the record and its compulsory and it’s open to an appeal procedure.

And in fact there are a few farmers at least aren’t there? 

Which makes me angry as well, really, because these farmers, you know… I know particularly one, that’s creating a lot of grief about it.  He’s got a million and he’s foot and mouth and I think there’s another thirty pound available, so they’re going to court over it, and you think, get a grip.  It obviously meant nothing  [PAUSE].   

Yes, it sort of went, it was compulsory, it wasn’t compulsory, it was voluntary, it wasn’t voluntary.  It was quite odd because we did that in here for five weeks, and as I say, when we were at Defra, we were put into a similar job, but it was the blood testing down in Penrith spur, they organised that on a grid system.  Oh they were faffing over there about what to do.  It was really quite odd, because we’d organised it in here, we knew [EMPHASIS] what systems were for ringing people, especially with people ringing back.  You know, you’ve got three thousand bits of paper, you need to sort out when people ring back.  Mark and I… It was when we were on the cross over on Wednesday… we said, look, this is what you need to do, do it this way and it will be fine. So we just put the system in place, and within a week we had it done, they’d rang everyone that needed to be done.  The person taking the return calls knew exactly where upon paper [PAUSE].  It was just so [EMPHASIS]   sorted.  There was a lot of disorganisation with things like that.

Were you dealing with stressed people?

Yes, tearful people as well.   I think on a level, people were more acceptable of us [EMPHASIS]  ringing than if someone from Defra had rang.

[SOMEBODY KNOCKING ON DOOR.  TAPE SWITCHED OFF]

We’ve seen a lot in here.  See when the cull finished, when we were really busy over  there, we got moved around two or three departments over there.  Surveillance ,  blood testing and the cleansing and disinfecting, and in the end they moved us into finance auditing, which is absolute dregs, it really was, but come the end of September, October, they said, right you’re needed back over here because then people were planning for forward sort of purchasing the stock back then, to move now.  So into contracts and paperwork, three of us doing the work of about twenty [PAUSE].  Looking back now it was quite easy really, because we opened last week, and when you’re brain has to start thinking again. I’ve been so tired for the last ten days [LAUGHTER] I thought, oh please [PAUSE].  It’s not passed but when you talk amongst people you think, well you know, it was an experience.

Getting on to the more personal, how were your parents throughout all this?

My parents [PAUSE] difficult [LONGISH PAUSE].  My partner C, she can never understand, because I don’t show a lot of emotion really, at anything, I never have done, that’s just the way I’ve been brought up.  Well when the sheep first went, I think that was the most traumatic day because between the two farms, we [EMPHASIS]  had most of the sheep at our farm, and the other farm had most of cattle, and when the sheep went that was a real traumatic day and that would be a Tuesday.  At that point I said, right we’ll have Mum and Dad down for a meal.  So I got them down, cooked a meal and as I say, the cattle went and their way of sort of getting by it really was, as I say, Mum took the dogs for a walk and Dad just helped them drag the carcasses away as they shot them.  But even now [EMPHASIS]  when you speak [PAUSE]…  well if you speak to Mam especially [PAUSE]…    when you talk about it, it’s still emotional, whereas me Dad’s very… well it’s happened you’ve got to get on.  He’s been looking forward to today for so [EMPHASIS]  long, if you ask him about it he says, well we’ll see, we’ll see.

Had they put themselves into voluntary isolation?

No.  We [EMPHASIS]  sort of put them into voluntary isolation really [LAUGHTER].   Well with working at the auction mart especially, I didn’t want to be travelling back.  But where I am, as I say, I live in H, so it was it was a lot easier for them to come by me, just park the car at the end of the road and walk in.  Whereas me taking the car back, we live sort of two miles off the road at home so… we didn’t go into that and by the time we actually got confirmed, there was only a forty-eight hour isolation period anyway.  You know, they both said the same thing; at the end of the day you’ve still got to live [PAUSE].  I think the people that have really suffered are [EMPHASIS]   the people that locked themselves into isolation for four, five or six months [PAUSE],  because they’ve lived with the telephone, what they saw on the news, and they’ve been driven absolutely crazy.  But you know, they just carried on as normal, they just travelled, like shopping… they didn’t do as much of it, but they did it.  As we got it at home, we live on the Longtown Brampton road and when it started to come along that road you could see it coming like a fire wall, it was bang, bang, that farm, that farm, that farm that farm, and it was just like well it’s going to come.  Dad said many a time I wish now we’d just got it.  He says, the agony of waiting for it is just killing us, and then bang, bang, bang and that was it.  We were the last farm along the road to go out.  We should have actually got taken out earlier as a direct contact as it were.  We shared the fields and the river with the farm that went down as an IP, went down about four or five weeks earlier, but basically defra didn’t have the staff to come and take us out as a DC [dangerous contact].

That must have been a potential…

That’s right.  We knew then [EMPHASIS]    that that was our holding.  Me Dad said they’re going to come, they’re going to come, and it was only later when [EMPHASIS]    they came to slaughter the stock as an actual IP.  They said, we’d have taken you out weeks ago but we didn’t have the staff to do it [PAUSE]  and that was likewise with the other farm, H, the farm next to it went down as an IP, and then we got slaughtered about five days later and they said the same thing to me Dad’s brother, we would have been back but there was no one to do it.  So the IPs were overtaken, actual direct contacts.   But no, my parents didn’t isolate themselves; they’re not those kind of people.

Did they have friends who did?  Presumably their social life was a bit upside down, was it?

It was.  Where we live at home, there’s an old track goes from the back of the house to the back of the pub in the next village. 

 That’s handy.  

Its very handy [LAUGHTER],  believe me, we had a quad bike back there, it was very very handy.   That track really was the social life.  Jump on the quad bike, it was always parked against the river, which is about five hundred yards from the farm, take it up to the pub, see who you wanted to see and come back.  They didn’t make sort of specific visiting runs.  The only person who they’d really go and visit would be my Grandmother who lived at Silloth.  Now my mum’s sister lived down the road from her and she wouldn’t [EMPHASIS]  leave the farm, but that was more of her I’m being a martyr, when she wanted to leave she did leave.  But there wasn’t any of their friends totally locked themselves in.  I think In this area, the general area as in around Longtown, they were more expectant of it and they knew there was nothing you could do about it, they were more acceptable, that well, you’re going to get it, you’re going to get it, whereas south, until it really got into Penrith, west coast, they didn’t have it specifically in that area, and they sort of thought, well if we close our doors, it’s not going to get here, whereas up here everybody realised well it doesn’t matter whether you close your doors or not, you’re going to get it.  When we got it, Aunty rang the farm next door. Now they’d been in isolation.   The farm next door to H, the land runs for about half a mile right at the side of the road it all runs parallel with each other, and she rang them on the morning she had a confirmed, and said, “I’m just ringing you to let you know we’ve had a cow go down this morning and the vets coming out.”  The guys response was, “oh shit”, and put the phone down, and that was it, they’ve never been out of the house. That was April, so three months they never left the farm.  We went down on the Tuesday they went down on the Thursday.

Have they since made contact?

Oh yes.  His reaction was just put the phone down.

So your father and his brother actually manage the two farms. Do they go back another generation to your grandparents?

My grandparents, yes they owned one of the farms and they bought the second farm.

Do they go back further?

I don’t think it does, no.  

So it’s a sort of a two-generation business really?

Yes.  They’ve always been in the area but not on those two particular farms.

What about your mother, because you said her sister also farms?

That’s right yes.  My Mum’s from farming background at Silloth.

None of them have travelled very far?

No it’s very county… well my father’s side of the family are all from K area, from three and a bit generations back, and they’re all that area.  My mum’s side of the family they’re from B and they’ve sort of moved round a little bit but not hundreds of miles.  They sort of see a better farm up the road so… 

You said your brother is not related to farming at all now?

He’s into steel erection.

Is he still in the county?

No, he travels all over the country.

But he visits regularly?

Oh yes, he comes back every weekend.  He’s got his own house. He’s bought himself a house, thought he would move out, realised he actually spent more time in other parts of the country than he did at home, so he’s finished the house, he’s renting it out and comes back to live at home at the weekend [LAUGHTER]. 

So is he younger than you?

He is, He’s five years, he’s twenty-five.  

Is your partner related to farming?

She is, yes.  She’s from down at Whitehaven.  Now, I think it was actually harder for her than it was for me because I’m only five miles from home; her parents are fifty miles from home.

  And not good roads. 

 No, she actually worked at W news, she works at C, reporter on the C.   She moved up here a week after it started, change of jobs, new area, living in a rented house at the time, knew no one except myself and she never got home for three months. In the end, the way it sort of broke the ice and we did go down was that her Dad got taken to hospital with the heart, and it was like some things are more important.  That was it, we started going down on a regular basis.

Is that a mixed farm?

It is yes.  It’s quite a large concern, predominately dairy but they took sheep for people over the winter.  They really got caught out, they had quite a lot of sheep on  for people and they couldn’t move them off.  They had to feed them, look after them, and even to the lambing stage.   It did become quite an in-joke because we’ve always had sheep at home 

[INTERRUPTED BY SOMEBODY ENTERING THE ROOM].  

No, it was generally a bit of a joke because they had these sheep on for the winter, we’ve lost our sheep, Cs Mum and Dad knew nothing about lambing sheep and my dad knew everything.  I said its fine just get dad down he’ll pitch a tent in the field, lamb the sheep and wont be a problem.  But in the end they did get them away. 

 I presume the owner must have been frantic.  

He wasn’t bothered, somebody else was looking after his sheep, he [EMPHASIS]  wasn’t bothered.  So really stuck in a hole, so it was hard for them not being used to working the sheep.

C your partner, was her Dad’s heart problems did she think was it  anything to do with the stress?

Well no. You don’t know, he just went in, they wired him up, stayed in a night, they didn’t know what it was, in the end sent him out.  They couldn’t pin it down to anything.  

But did he himself say anything?

No, no.  He just said he wasn’t feeling too good in the afternoon, took him in, straight in and just saw nothing really.

Do you know if he’s got a history of heart disease?

The family has a history of heart problems.

Do you think all the changes and everything you had to deal with directly affected your health?

Last year up to the end of June, July, we were coming in here like zombies [PAUSE].  You weren’t sleeping for a start.  You looked at people, and how people reacted to people as well.  When it very first broke out, we let some lambs out one morning at home, and one of them just a bit lame, one of the first signs, so I said to them in here, look, we’ve had a lamb gone away for testing.  People didn’t know whether they could talk to you and you felt like an absolute leper.  You’d come in here, just close the doors, and you thought, oh please.  But as it went on, and more it just became accepted, and then DH a guy out of here, he went down about the end of March, he was like one of the first staff to go down, it was like the ice broke.  It was only then [EMPHASIS] when someone went down [EMPHASIS]  that people… David was like, phew thank God, he says I’ve never slept for six weeks.  Then when people start talking about it, you know, they haven’t slept, they just haven’t felt like going out.  It became a routine, every second night, you’d go from here, go over to Tesco’s, get a bottle of wine and you’d go home and you’d just try [EMPHASIS]   and switch off.  That almost sounds like people were alcoholics, but it wasn’t a case of that, I just think it got to a point where you weren’t sleeping and you were just fed-up with it and you thought that was it, just stop in the house.  

[INTERRUPTED BY SOMEONE ENTERING THE ROOM].   

So that was the routine.  From here you went to Tesco’s, and it became a joke that you would go to Tesco’s and you’d meet everyone that you’d seen in the day because they’re all wandering up and down the wine aisle looking for a bottle of wine to take home, and that was brought up at that meeting the other week.  Everyone was the same, go home and have a drink. 

 I must admit I often felt like smoking.  I’m not anti smoking or anything but there’s times when you just thought [PAUSE]  phew.  But rocketing alcohol consumption, and eating more as well [PAUSE]  comfort eating.  You go out and you just buy rubbish [EMPHASIS].  

Again there were big extremes weren’t there, of those who ate more than they normally would and those that couldn’t [emphasis] eat.  

Yeh, and those who couldn’t eat [PAUSE].  It sort of blew us apart really in here for a start because when we went over to maff, it became a fight [EMPHASIS] at the start.  Everyone thought, right, this place, there is never going to be this number of staff required again, it became a fight, everyone was just after number one and from being a very close team…  I say, myself, I’ve been here fourteen years and you’re really very much a family and all of a sudden everyone was very much on their own, if you went to talk to somebody you didn’t know whether they were going to snap, they were going to ignore you [PAUSE]  and it’s not conducive to a good working…  with that time there wasn’t work happening anyway, but then as I say, went over to defra and when we came back over, people bonded very quickly because people realised, you know, that you’re needed.  We need to be working together, it was no good working apart, you had to be working together, but you know, do people wanna talk to me, or… 

What is your official role?

Assistant Finance Manager [PAUSE]  debt collector [CHUCKLE]  That’s what I do.

So people do come to you [emphasis] that’s your role and staff come to you? 

Yes. 
 And you’re dealing in a quite sensitive area as well?

I’m not Manager of the office, but you get seen as someone to come and talk to [PAUSE] which, it doesn’t bother me.  I’ve always been a person who can sit and listen to people, and I can sit and talk to people [PAUSE] and yet [PAUSE]  emotionally, things don’t sort of generally get to me, I’ve always been quite cold in that sense.

But who do you [emphasis] go to?

Who do I [EMPHASIS]   go to [PAUSE] in here [PAUSE]  if I have an emotional problem. 

 Yes. 

 No one really.  If anyone [EMPHASIS]  I would go to M, who is almost our , personal department, she’s mainly there, and that’s quite good because that’s who you should be going to.

Throughout that critical period did you feel… [PAUSE]  It sounds like there’s survival tactics going on?

It is yeh.  Throughout that critical period you can go and talk to anyone.  You didn’t, you went [PAUSE] you’d go home, sometimes we didn’t even talk about it [PAUSE]  but [PAUSE].   I actually [EMPHASIS]  found it easier talking to people that I knew who lived at other ends of the county [PAUSE] who were nowhere near it.

Are these friends?

Friends [EMPHASIS] yeh.  I know a few who sort of live Dundee area, Perth area, it was ring them, or down at Marlborough and Wiltshire and Bristol.  I found it easier to ring them [EMPHASIS] than to ring people who I go out with every weekend, every second weekend, than speak to them.

So are these people in farming?

No.

But they have some understanding?

Yeh, they’ve lived among farming but they don’t farm their actual selves.  As I say it was easier to speak to them than it was to speak to people who you went out with because every [EMPHASIS]  night, if you did go out with people regularly, all [EMPHASIS]   it came back to was foot and  mouth [PAUSE]  who’d gone down this week and what’s going to happen now, and oh things will never be the same again and, you know, there’s no future in it and all the farms are going to go sky high. Living somewhere else, completely different view on life really.

What do you think of the media coverage?

Crap.

Is that national?

National.  Local media and radio coverage [PAUSE]  very informed, very professional and very correct.  National, really didn’t want to know [PAUSE]  you know, they were after the big headlines [PAUSE]  they weren’t concerned.

Were you approached by the national media?

No, not in here.  Some of the more senior staff were but not in here.  I don’t think I would have gone and talked if they had.  After that, I’ve got no trust of national media or Government at all [EMPHASIS].  This last week being an excellent example.  We are going to have a transport Minister splattered on the front pages, suspected foot and mouth case.  There’s been three cases like that in Cumbria in the last four weeks, which the local newspapers have covered and said, nothing to worry about, could be positive antibodies.   That’s never hit National press.  No, I don’t think the national media covered it very well at all really.  They were showing these pyres, weeks [EMPHASIS]  after the last pyre had gone out [PAUSE]  and it went beyond [EMPHASIS]   that when they brought Brigadier in, it went beyond that.  I often sit back and say, what did he do.  She [C his wife]  says Brigadier came and took the pain away, she says he tidied everything up and he took the pain away, and yet even four, five weeks after he was here, they’re still [EMPHASIS]   showing the pyres, because the pyre was the image wasn’t it.  It’s like September the 11th and the towers, the pyres were the image.  As I say, it was the headline and once that’s gone [PAUSE] and everyone forgot about it [PAUSE],  end of June it was the elections on and the media forgot about it.  It was still going on, there was cases right up until the end of August, and then drip drip drip, 30th of September that was it.  But locally I thought it was excellent.  Well locally the papers have won national awards for the coverage of it.

Do you think that’s in part because some of the staff have got farming backgrounds?

Well perhaps.  I know C covered a lot.  I think that was an outlet for me.  She’d come home and say I’m doing this story, what do you think about it, and we’d sit together and type the story and I’d say I want my by-line on the front [LAUGHTER] page as well.  She was working late the night that Nick Brown did the U-turn and at six o’clock the pages were all set that Thursday night to go with this headline, and then the U-turn.  She came back at half eleven that night, …she was a bit disenchanted wondering whether she’d done the right thing moving to C… and she came back and says, now I know what journalisms about, she says, we just totally turned it, she says, the editor was standing on my shoulder rattling it out and the whole thing changed.  But I also think there’s a knowledge side of it which is good reporting but there is also the readership of the people who know [EMPHASIS & PAUSE]   and if they pick that up and read it and its not right… you know, if someone in Longtown picked the paper up and the [local paper] say, had gone with the headline, ‘H pyre not to go ahead’,  having all stood there and watch it being lit [PAUSE], they would throw it out and they would probably never again have a circulation In Longtown.  It’s like Radio Cumbria [PAUSE]     if they don’t tell people the truth [PAUSE]  the listeners just turn off and they never come back.  Whereas the Nationals, the Cumbrians, it’s a dot isn’t it, not many people live in Cumbria.  They sell like a million newspapers in London so they’re not bothered [PAUSE].  My parents were at a wedding , summer of last year, and there was a gentleman and he was up from Essex, and he was at the bar as it was, and Thomas my dads friend, and they were talking and this guy turned round and said, you’ve had foot and mouth and you’re from Cumbria, and me Dad says yes. He took his drink and said, can I come and sit down with you for half an hour or so and tell me what it’s all about because he says we hear nothing of it down with us.  And that was Essex, where the first case was.  Case number one was in Essex.  Me Dad says he was so interested he wanted to know [EMPHASIS].

I’m aware that time is moving on, but can you just say what was the worst bit about foot and mouth for you?

The worst [EMPHASIS] bit [PAUSE], the worst bit absolutely, personally, being selfish, was when we got called into here and they said right [PAUSE],  going half time, we don’t know where we’re going from here.  I know that’s selfish but all sorts of things flash before you, like thinking am I going to have a job.  You know, it happens everyday, everywhere doesn’t it, people get made redundant.  That one instance you thought it’s going to be quite big.  A more personal level really I think, it was when we went down really.  As I say we went down [culled] on the 14th, on the 10th sorry, they lost the sheep, on the 24th they lost the cattle and then on the 23rd of May we lost my Grandma and it all just sort of bang bang bang.  That six weeks was just absolutely…  Cos we were into lent and I’d given up chocolate [CHUCKLES]   and it got to the point and I went home and said bollocks to it, sod it.

Was you’re Grandmother’s death expected?

No it wasn’t really.  No it wasn’t expected.  It took a fortnight to get over the sheep going, three weeks to get over the cattle going and then it was just a roll on.  You know, April, May and June weren’t good months at all.          

Was there anything good that came out of it?

We’ve had a lot of jokes out of it because it got to a point where you had to walk out of here.  I’d open that door and walk out of here and all you’d see would be… I can’t work in that, I can’t  be done with seeing people like that and [PAUSE],  I think there was actually a real sort of [PAUSE]  you know, at the end there was a real sort of comraderie about it.  We were all… [PAUSE],  you know, you’d come in and you’d walk around the office and you’d maybe swear and you’d be like oops I shouldn’t do that round the office and then the boss would walk in, and he’d just had the same problem you’d had and he’d walk in and swear right in front of the office [LAUGHTER], and it’s moments like that which are just absolute gems.  I couldn’t say to you that there’s one moment in that year where I think, you know, I’ll always remember that.  I don’t think there were any great moments for anyone.

Finally, how do you see the future of farming in Cumbria?

Knackered.   

That’s what you personally feel?

Yes, knackered [PAUSE].  Not a very nice word that is it [LAUGHTER].

  I know where you’re coming from.   

 No, Cumbria, it’s a livestock breeding ground.  If you’ve got a factory you’ve got production, Cumbria’s your production, that’s where the stock in the country comes from.  Cumbria, South West Scotland.

Are you talking particularly about pedigree stock?

I’m talking about all stock [PAUSE].  Farmers were struggling before this [PAUSE], they’d turned the corner after BSE, things had got past the bottom out, started to pick up, and now [EMPHASIS]  they [PAUSE]  they’re trying to get back again.  There’s not as many farmers are going to go back in [PAUSE].  I don’t think foot and mouth can be blamed for it, it’s a worldwide thing, that’s what a lot of farmers have to recognise.  Trade now is worldwide, it’s not just Cumbria and England, it’s a global market.  I think unless farmers in Cumbria really increase in size [PAUSE]  right across the board [PAUSE], which, the majority of farmers in Cumbria are unable to do [PAUSE], then the future for farming, well it’s dire.  We see it in here; the young kids aren’t coming on [PAUSE].  You know, we farm, my brother and I aren’t coming on, five years of your farm on the market.  You can walk out in to the rings [at the auction mart] today and it will all [EMPHASIS]   be over fifty year olds, the young people aren’t coming on.   If those people aren’t following through, then in ten, fifteen, twenty years there’s going to be no one there and I don’t think the infrastructure in farming can support it.  There’s a lot of money swilling out there at the moment.  I’m not getting away from that, there’s a lot [EMPHASIS]  of money circling in the farming community at the moment, but beyond that I really don’t think farming will ever take off again.  I think it’s going to contract now.  We’ve seen it in 67, you know, foot and mouth was concentrated in the Cheshire area, you know, the Crewe area, and when they recovered, it came back a wealthy area, farming dairy herds the likes there.  But I say, we’re in different times now, you know, food didn’t travel out of the country then.

You said something interesting.  You said you feel farming can’t [emphasis] increase, is that partly geography?

Yeh, you know, if you look at Cumbria, we’ve got what, 75 percent of it’s Lake District.  We’re talking fells here [SENTENCE EMPHASISED];  we’re talking massive planning restrictions.  You can’t just decide you want to knock a shed up because you need to take a hundred cattle on to make a profit, you just can’t do it.   The Government want those farms, not to farm and the farmer to be paid to look after the hills.  Custodians of the country side [PAUSE]   lovely, yeh [PAUSE].   You know it might work in theory, my father’s very of the attitude, he says, well if he wants to pay me to plough a field [PAUSE]  fine.  

I think people outside of the county don’t really take in some of those very practical restrictions, like if you had a large site then you can have massive great machinery, that’s actually quite difficult isn’t it, in places like the hills farms.  

Yeh, the hills, you’d be lucky to get a tractor up them [LAUGHTER]. 

So shouldn’t we be trying to hang on to hill farming?

Well this is it, I think once you lose them… at the end of it it’s like every business, it comes down to the bottom line, the economics have to be there, and we’ve seen it since we’ve opened here, we were putting most of our prime stock direct to the abattoirs [PAUSE].  Farmers don’t like it because the abattoirs pay a    lesser price that way, whereas when it’s in a public market place, then we have competition and you get the correct market value. Now we’ve opened our public market place and the buyers prime stock just aren’t coming, so they’ve said right, we’re [EMPHASIS] not coming.  So that’s where the price is going to be, as I say, it’s going to be a dead weight [PAUSE] and the market price is forcing that, you can’t do anything about it.  It’s like if a restaurant is too dear you just don’t go.  Your hands are tied, so we as a business have got to try and encourage farmers to go that route and try and work with them.  But economically farmers they wont be making a lot of money out of it.

So do you think there has got to be a more responsible consumer response as well?

Consumers could help [EMPHASIS & PAUSE], but again it’s bottom line.  If you’ve got two roasts of beef on a shelf and one of them is £2 and one of them is £5.50 and it’s organically produced on a Cumbrian fell, you’re not going to buy.  The majority of people, I don’t think they would. Anyway that’s my feeling about it.
  

But I suppose the idea is if you increase the market.  This idea of actually getting back to, for example, the abattoirs.  I mean how many abattoirs were around in 67; how far [emphasis] do livestock travel to be slaughtered.

You’re right.  It was an ideal exit.  All this travel that they see in this country, it all brings focus back to the auction marts [PAUSE].  We have been seen throughout as being the bad guys amongst this and we’re like an estate agent really, we’re trying to get the best price for the vendor than we can, we’re an agent , we’re a broker.  Now with the abattoirs, fair enough, the stock has to travel and I don’t agree with animal cruelty what so ever, I would never condone animal cruelty, but some of the wagons that come into here take stock away whether they’re going fifty miles or five hundred miles, are better [EMPHASIS]   kitted out than some of the buses that we’ll take to go to a pop concert or a football match [PAUSE].   If we had a bus up to the same standard, you would quite happily travel a thousand miles [PAUSE].  Now the nearest abattoirs to us now, here are Lockerbie and Newcastle really [PAUSE], Whitley bay.  So you’re talking eighty mile at tops [EMPHASIS] to get to Whitley bay.  That [EMPHASIS]   is perceived in some circles as being too far [PAUSE].  I question it; I think well it’s not a distance at all. 

 Particularly when you’re bringing stock in from somewhere say like Belgium. 

  Exactly.  

And they all have to come in through Dover now don’t they?  

So they’ve got to travel four hundred mile north before they even get up here.  All these French cattle that the farms are buying are pedigree stock, here’s an example, it’s having to go down [EMPHASIS],    across and then back up.  You’re talking nearly a thousand miles. 

Is there also about a nine-hour restriction?  

Yes, there’s only a particular journey time.

  So if you have to come up from Dover it’s almost like you’re penalised if…  

Yes, you might have to stop at south Cumbria, because you’re up to your nine hours you can’t go any further [EMPHASIS].  

There are quite a lot of anomalies aren’t there. 

  There are a lot of anomalies; there are a lot of things, which… there’s a lot of finger pointing [PAUSE]  which is unfortunate.  As I say, I think farming, say talk about its future, I think geographically that plays a major role in it, It doesn’t allow the expansion that would probably be required on a lot of farms.   Also breeding wise really, as in people, there aren’t the young people coming on, so these farms… I think it’s going to be like an organic growth, a farm won’t be able to expand until the farmer next door either retires or passes away and then they’ll buy up that.  But that’s going to be a long [EMPHASIS]   process, and come that time by then, I think we’ll be out of it [PAUSE]   you know, we’ll be out of it and it will just be a direct between farmers.  I can see us in five years, maybe ten years, we’ll just have an office, smaller than this and there’ll be just six or seven of us handling paper. 

  I quite like the way you described that, that kind of estate agent handling.  

Yes, it will all be direct and we’ll just act as broker for the goods really.  

So are you looking for another job?

I have done and as much as I have enjoyed being open again I think now it’s best just to walk away really. 

 Sorry to get so personal.  

 No, I sat an Open University degree.  I can’t be bored, I thought right I’ll go and do an Open University degree.  I got two years into it and then the board in here asked me if I would like to do my company secretarial exams.  So I thought right, it’s a good opportunity; they’re prepared to put me through them, which is a considerable cost that I couldn’t stand.  They’re prepared to put me through it and if I get that then basically the world is open to you because it’s an internationally recognised qualification.   But at the same time I still… I can’t see me being here for ever [PAUSE], not for a lot longer.  It’s becoming samee.  A lot of people enjoy the paper chase [PAUSE]   some people enjoy it, you know, taking that and putting it there.  No, you’ve got to be creative.  We’re on a project at the moment redesigning the office, completely redecorating and redesigning the office, that’s something you can get you’re teeth in to.  I can’t be sitting; I feel I’m starting to stagnate now.   Fourteen years in this same office.  

Is there anything you would like to say that I haven’t asked?

No.   As I say I just look at the general pain and I think it’s one experience that … you know, I’m not even bitter towards the Government, I’m not bitter towards anyone, you know, I don’t feel aggrieved.  Everyone will have their own views and people will blame it, oh it’s all a set up or whatever.  I just find it really sad that, as I say, if that case this week had been confirmed, we would have been in the same mire probably that we were.  

Desperate. 

 Yes, and the only thing that would have stopped it is that the stock aren’t out there to slaughter out.

What lessons have we learned?

I don’t think any.  I said this same conversation to my Mum and Dad about three weeks ago when I saw these farmers restocking, like a train, oh he’s got stock in his fields I’ll have to get stock.  You know, it snowballs doesn’t it.  I was sitting one day and I says to my dad, you know, farmers have learned nothing.  Farmers have learned nothing [EMPHASIS]  in the last twelve months.  He’s says, no, your right, they’re just trying to carry on as normal.  I says the Government’s learned nothing.  I’ve been over at Defra, I’ve seen
all the work that they don’t [EMPHASIS]  learn anything, you know, they don’t write a system [EMPHASIS]   down [PAUSE]  they don’t write a system down that works.  I can guarantee you now, if we went back over there tomorrow and there was a sheep cull or a gridded structure, you know blood testing to be done, it would be as big a mire as it was last time.   That’s what I’ve found most disappointing, no-ones learnt anything.  Well I don’t feel any-ones learned anything.  You know, the headlines when it hit after that suspect this week was just like it was last year, the same headlines [EMPHASIS], foot and mouth suspect. 

 Yes, certainly in the National news  wasn’t it.  

Yes.  Well, it was.  That was [EMPHASIS] different, they slammed the restrictions on straight, away eight kilometres right around, which didn’t happen before.  But as I say, generally, I don’t think they’ve learned anything.  The particular time it happened right through the summer, all the staff were uni and schools out for six weeks, two months or whatever they’re out for.  So they were drifting in, they were drawing fifteen pounds an hour [PAUSE]  and drifting out.  It’s nearly bad on our part as well, because knowing farming, and knowing that you’re going there saying, well this is what you should be doing.  

Frustrating. 

 Frustrating yes, but you’ve got twenty walls of bureaucracy to get through and sometimes it’s just right, you’re making decision, this is what we’re doing [PAUSE].. and no as I say I’m not bitter about anything, I’m just.. you’ve just got to get on haven’t you.  As I say you can’t dwell, I still LIKE a bottle of wine now and then [CHUCKLES].  I don’t think that’s a problem that’s stuck [PAUSE].  There’s  moments, Tuesday night when that foot and mouth hit, I didn’t sleep Tuesday night, that’s why I’ve been so tired this week.  It’s been like, oh here we go again.  I think C was worse than I was [PAUSE],   because her parents hadn’t gone, you know, still had their stock, she was worse than I was.  It got to about two o clock and I thought we might as well go upstairs and watch a film; it’s pointless laying in bed.  No it has been an eventful time.           
  

I was thanked for his time

Gender: M
Occupation: Group 3
Geographic region: North Cumbria

Can I ask about your background?

Originally from, well fetched up in Carlisle so born and bred round here.  My mother was from out west and my father from Heathersgill.  I went to school in Carlisle and worked on building sites and farms and the like and then I went to As and I've been there over 16 year.

And you’re into livestock?

Aye livestock haulage.

So what made you go into farming?

Well I don't know really, it's what you do round here.  My first farm I was taking on and I took to it really enjoyed it, it was me like.  I think it's that you know, it's what you do round here.

So your family aren't in farming?

Me Dad is, well they both are really, me Mam is as well.  Oh Aye me Dad had worked on farms all his life really.

So maybe that's how you became interested?

Oh aye undoubtedly and it felt good ye know when I knew I had a feel fer it. [Pause]

And you said your Mum is from farming too?

Oh aye her family farmed back end of [tape inaudible here], aye yes.

And do you see your parents regularly?

Oh aye .

And where do they live now?

Oh still in Carlisle so it's on doorstep really.

Do you have brothers and sisters?

I've two brothers.  One lives in Carlisle and the other lives [tape inaudible here]

So are you quite close?

Aye like most folk ye know. I phone them 'n that, oh aye.

And your brothers are they in agricultural work?

No, no.  They used to be both of them used to work for As alongside me, ye know in livestock haulage.   Well one of them 

[TAPE INAUDIBLE HERE]

And you're married?

Aye yeah. 15 month

So were you married before?

Aye.  [wife] she's from one of the islands north of Scotland, place called  Islay [long pause]

Oh yes, great single malts.

Oh aye there's a lot of them, a lot, seven, seven I think.  Yeah we were there you know at lambing time at her place and aye the malts, they're right proud of those.

So [wife] has a farming background?

Aye that's right.

And do you have children?

Well not with [wife], I have a boy, 4 year old from my first marriage.  I see him like at week-ends and in the holiday.  He's a good lad.

Have your parents spoken about the 67 foot and mouth outbreak?

Me Dad was saying that at the time of the 67 outbreak there was some talk of it o'er Gretna and stock were taken out and that were it. I mean some folk say there's too much stock this time but you can say what you like, my Dad says in 67 they didn't mess about, stock taken out and lifted straight away and that was it, and no-one, and I mean no-one allowed on farm until it was sorted.  So the restrictions, okay they were hard but folk could see result.  This time and like round here [Longtown] the first pyre they built, they sent wrong coal it wouldn't burn, they sent wrong coal. It was erm furnance coal not stuff for open air.  They were having to go and heat it and create drafts and all sorts but it just wouldn't burn.  There was one farmer, he went down with foot and mouth and they spent all night putting coal in his coal shed loading it with wheel barrow and then next day as soon as they put it on pyre, it went out.  An then they spent the next day [laughing] they spent all day shovelling it back out again.  And it was the lads at Cumbria Construction and they was saying this is stuff that they burn at Sellafield but DEFRA weren't listening and the mess that some of these lads were making on farms, trying to build pyres, fetching coal and then fetching it back again, you've no idea.  So disorganised, so disorganised (shakes his head and reaches for his cigarettes).

Hmm [Pause] If I can take you back, what was your first memory of this foot and mouth outbreak?

On Tuesday night there was that case in Essex [pause] it didn't really affect us at first.  I mean then there was the sale [auction mart] here at Longtown on the Thursday.  Everybody was very wary mind buying stock and then Friday dinnertime we got the phone call that as from Friday midnight there was to be no movement of livestock and the mad rush

   Tape very difficult to follow from here. With respondent’s permission second interview was carried on on 3.12.02.  Please see below.



I was born at Brampton. My mother and father lived at Penton but I spent most of my life in Carlisle before I moved down here but I wouldn’t have said, I just, I don’t know, I couldn’t wait to get out of Carlisle. I didn’t like living in the town and I always had an interest round about the countryside and farming and that I suppose it was the job as well. It got to the stage where you were… The hours we work, I was ---- like travelling back and forth to Carlisle every day like if you got caught in the traffic you were home 6 or 7 hours and you were heading back to work again.

Yes, it’s got worse hasn’t it now.

Yes, it’s a nightmare around Carlisle.

So just remind me when you left school, is that when you decided that you wanted to do agricultural work?

No, I was… before I left school I used to go to a farm at Crosby in October time, picking potatoes and I just stopped on just every weekend and school holidays and help him and just whenever I could and I tried for numerous apprenticeships. A mechanic, I wanted to be a mechanic initially and when I didn’t get any of them, I just went into labouring and farm work. I was on building sites but it always seemed to come back to agriculture in one way or another.

Yes, it’s interesting isn’t it because you’ve not got.. have you got farming in your background?

I had an uncle who had a farm. My dad worked  on farms all his younger days and mam was of farming background so I don’t know, I just was interested in it. You were doing something different every day. You weren’t doing the same thing. You were doing something different every day working with animals and tractors and you just and you could see something at the end of it. When you were milking cows you had a whole tank full of milk. If you were fattening cattle or fattening sheep, you see the end product.

But your brothers have they gone into similar kind of work?

No they both got apprenticeships, one time served as a mechanic and the other one’s a time served auto mechanic. They got their apprenticeships. So one of them, well, they both drove for us for a while. We got them both jobs down there. They were both on the livestock wagons for a while but they’ve both, although they’ve time served, they’ve both ended up driving wagons, but there is a national shortage now of skilled people in general, not just mechanics, there’s joiners, plumbers. There’s a national shortage of skilled people.

We have two, or we have three lads at work. One of them started in the warehouse and the lads that wash containers, they are going through a ‘young drivers scheme’ to get their licences which encourages young lads in because they know they are going to something at the end of it. But that’s the general, not just younger people. D. was away at a meeting last week and it was supposed to be to find out what the new rules and regulations on livestock haulage was, and they done a survey of drivers and it was stress on the driver, not the animal.

That’s interesting.

And the three biggest things that caused the stressing the drivers was paperwork, traffic and the washes in abattoirs.

That’s interesting.

They say if you get to the root of it. If a driver is stressed the animals end up being stressed. If you get the drivers calm and relaxed the animals will be the same way because they will treat them that way. And I suppose in a way it’s true. Its only taken them ten year to realise that because some of the washers, I’ve seen some of our lads, five and six hours to wash a container out because they haven’t got the facilities basically and somebody in Defra  decided when foot and mouth came on tap, a pressure washer was adequate enough to wash a container and it’s not. 


So when foot and mouth struck, perhaps you could just tell me in your own words you know what you remember? Your own story really in terms of what happened at work and how you had to deal with it?

Everything stopped very quickly. It was just announced on the television that they had found foot and mouth somewhere and it was a bit, nobody really, it was kind of hard to take in to start with because nobody knew just what the implications was going to be and that was on a Wednesday, I think it was, and then they announced on the Thursday that they were going to stop all livestock movements at midnight on the Friday night so it was a mad rush to empty the market, which in hind sight was a bad thing because it went to places where it should never have gone. But, DEFRA didn’t realise just how far and how quick and how many animals moved because after the Friday, the Monday, I mean we had a fleet of 22 livestock wagons parked in the field and it was a case of try and diversify quickly. But nobody knew when they were going to let them start moving again or just how bad it was going to get so everything was parked up so we sat down and we just pressure washed everything from top to bottom, inside and out and on the Monday or the Tuesday, there was more cases coming in and it started to affect the milk tankers and everything. I mean a lot of the lads off the livestock wagons were going with milk tankers because they were spraying the wheels in and out of every farm and so they were taking a spare man with them to try and keep up with times basically but if a farm fell into the three kilometre zone, the milk had to be picked up separately, so it was putting a lot of pressure on the.. so they were putting two men on them wagons to kind of ease it a bit. And then things, it was the second or the third week and there was more and more cases coming in. On the Tuesday, Trading Standards phoned, somebody from DEFRA, they wanted to know the movement of the sheep we had fetched from Hexham to Longtown the week of foot and mouth broke out, so faxed them all the details, the delivery notes and our running sheets and everything else and come back for a bit more and in the finish, we said, “ well we’ll just send you everything that we’ve done for the month leading up to foot and mouth so you can trace it”  and we just took it all off the computer and there was a pile of paper – it was about four inches thick and we said to tell them, well we had delivered it and they come back on the phone and they says, “ well what’s all this” and I said, “well that’s what we have moved in the last month.”

Yes, because Longtown is one of the biggest marts, isn’t it?

They could have up to. I’ve seen some fairs in Longtown that have had 20,000 plus sheep in the one day. They just didn’t…. And going to all four corners of the country. They had gone by Friday or Saturday morning – everything gone. In and out, on the same day or the next day.

And before foot and mouth, what is also interesting, there was a lot of paperwork wasn’t there?

There was. We still had a lot, because you had your sheep and goat movement licences, your animal movement sheets. We have to keep a record in the office of everything that had been moved and you had to keep them records. So I mean, if all the movement was there, they could have come…..we had Trading Standards used to come in once or twice a year and check all our movement sheets and sign them so, I mean, Trading Standards knew what was being moved. DEFRA just didn’t have a clue. They just didn’t realise how much was being moved.

And did you have employees who were actually also part of a farm?

Most of our part time lads are farmers’ sons. If the farm isn’t big enough to pay two wages, the son will work part time for us and help on the farm when they’re at home.

What happened to them?

They had to go home. They daren’t come out because I mean, we had friends  in Penton and we used to go and meet them at the road end and take them groceries and because they daren’t. They were so frightened that they were going to catch this. They daren’t come out, so a lot of our lads were the same. Any of them that had anything to do with farming went home and stopped at home or else they come to work and they stopped elsewhere and they just stayed well clear of the farm. They daren’t do anything else.

So in terms of laying people off, I mean it was alright at that stage because of the pressure washing?

Well, we were lucky because the general haulage side of the business was expanding anyways, so we put the units off our trailers. We just took a little bit more work on. We do a lot for Carlsberg and Tetley beer and they used to fetch the beer up from Leeds and Northampton, Birmingham, up to our depot and then we took it scotch [Scotland] the next morning, while they just put their wagons elsewhere and we put our own wagons on. Doing the trucks as well so we got a lot of the lads onto other things, but they’re some of them won’t come back now because they’ve seen another lifestyle. They won’t go back to livestock.

Because of what?

They’ve seen an easier lifestyle and a lot less hassle. 

Right. Less hard work?

Well a lot less hassle as well. They haven’t got half the paperwork and they haven’t got somebody breathing down their neck all the time.

Are the wages the same D.?

You actually make more on the livestock. We pay over a pound an hour more for livestock.

But still they don’t want to do it?

No, they don’t want to, no.

That’s interesting isn’t it?

Because it’s a dirty job and a lot of it is done at night. I mean if you go over to K, you can load in a factory at 6 or 7 o’ clock in the morning, do your driving, you’re packed up at 8 o’ clock at night at the latest and that’s you and you’re clean. But with livestock, the markets on through the day, and maybe don’t finish that until 3, 4 o’ clock in the afternoon and then you’ve got to start and work.

And now of course, you’ve got all these restrictions and the clocks ticking all the time isn’t it?

Well, it is because it’s not just as bad as it was but when they first started the live sales, everything had to be out of the market by 10 o’ clock at night.
And now they’re either on a two day licence or a three day licence and you don’t know whether they’re on two days, whether they’re on three days, but the three days, a Tuesday, a Wednesday and a Thursday in Calrisle are three consecutive sales and allow the Tuesday, the cattle could stop over, and the cattle for Wednesday come in on a Tuesday but Wednesday night the market had to be emptied, disinfected before anything for Thursdays sale could come in. I sat at Rosehill with a load of cattle for an hour and a half until they washed the market.

So it brings everything to a standstill?

Where’s the  animal welfare? There’s no, when we first started, when they allowed movements to go again by licence the driver wasn’t even allowed to stop for a pee. Once he left, he couldn’t stop, well, until he got to his destination. If it was more than four and a half hours, you had to put two drivers on the wagon, so it didn’t stop. It was allowed to pull up on the hard shoulder. They weren’t allowed to pull into lay bys. They had to find somewhere like the hard shoulder on the slip road off a motorway and you had to make sure that there was no stock within a 2-300 yard radius. Swap drivers, and away again. They weren’t even allowed to stop for the toilet. 

It is. How are you meant to check your livestock? If you’re on a journey of 8 or 9 hours, you weren’t even allowed to stop and check the livestock to see if it was alright. 

So it makes a mockery of the system?

It does make a mockery of the whole system.

But going back to when the foot and mouth outbreak was really at its height, I mean, your firm got quite involved in trying to dispose of carcasses?.

Well, it wasn’t, we had nothing to do with the carcasses because of other livestock and the milk, we had nothing to do. It was the contiguous cull. It was live sheep in to Great Orton we were involved in.

Right so that was later on then wasn’t it?

It was only I suppose three week in, because it escalated that quick. It was only about three week in when they decided they were going to have to get rid of the sheep to slow this thing down, which it did. There was a lot of, I mean, there was 20 or 30 thousand sheep killed in about five week, in the space of five week, but it did work, but a lot of it was a waste. 

Can you remember what it was like on a day-to-day basis throughout that time? 

Well, it was alright.

Long hours?

Well, we work long hours any ways. DEFRA couldn’t believe that we could work 15, 16, 17, 18 hours a day, every day of the week. They couldn’t because they work 9 to 4:30 and they think the rest of the world works 9 to 4:30 and they couldn’t. They’re still questioning the hours. They couldn’t believe anybody could work that many hours.

In terms of payment now?

Yeah. But they can’t believe.

Yes, there’s a lot of anger about that isn’t there?

It’s everyday to us, but it was one of them things, you ‘hed’ that feeling, it had to be done, and the only way to do it was to get on and do it, but I mean they were for their own figures, I mean we were supposed to lift 2000 sheep the first day. We had 72 vehicles running when it was in its height. We were shifting 20-25, 000 head of livestock a day off maybe 50 or 55 different farms.

You’ve got 72 vehicles? 

We used all Cumbrian hauliers. We never fetched anyone in from anywhere else.

So they were all from within the county?

They were all from the county. All the staff on Great Orton and all the staff in Carlisle were all lads that had been made redundant off farms and markets and there was the odd one or two that come from outside but very few.

So how did that work? Would people ring you? 

We just. . . . .D. went for a meeting with the brigadier on the Sunday and he said I want this I want that and I want that, how long will it take you to get it up and running? I don’t care what it costs.  And D. says hold on a minute and he says, “ I’ll talk to you but you cant just say I want this and that” and he says,  “right lets sit down and lets sort it out.” So we phoned every haulier in Cumbria we knew on the Monday. We phoned farmers, markets, wherever to try and contact the staff. We phoned recruitment agencies and we had a meeting at Penrith on the  Monday night with all the hauliers to see if they were in agreement with it if they would do it. We were basically pushed into it. We didn’t really want to get involved with it but we were basically pushed into it because being the biggest haulier in basically in Europe, they came to us and basically pushed us in and said you do it.

They wanted you to co-ordinate it?

They wanted us to do it.

So why didn’t you want to do it? Did you feel it could…

Because at the end of the day, the Government and the army can home back to London.

But you were here?

Yeah there were friends, customers, relatives. We’re still here. We have still got to try and make a living after all those fellas have gone home. When you were going into a farm and taking their lives away, you’re not so keen on coming  back, which was the most difficult part of it. Never in short space of time, in 5 week, it was a short space of time, I’ve never heard as many grown men cry as what I did in that time. A lifetime’s work gone within two or three hours. We had an old man at Aspatria, he was absolutely broken hearted, when we phoned him and there was 3, I think it was 3 or 4 wagons went and he said, “ make sure you come half an hour earlier and I’ll get the dinners before we load the sheep” and he fed them and when the sheep was loaded he took them into the house and gave them a cup of tea before they went.  Because they were the same way. They knew it was a lifetime’s work but if they ‘hed’ dairy cows, there was a chance that they could save the cows if the sheep went and it did. It’s been condemned a lot, the cull, afterwards, but people realise, I mean, we had a map in the office of how it was spreading. It would be 6 foot by 4 foot, the map. It was massive and you could see where it was moving and the army lads and some of the Chief Vets of Great Orton said when it was in its height, there was between 5 and 7 different strains of foot and mouth. And by the time the sheep were taken out, it was back down to one strain, because it was getting hold of the sheep and spreading that fastly. It was spreading a kilometre a week right through the county.

So as far as you are concerned then, that was the turning point then, though it was very, very difficult to do this contiguous cull? 

It was but they wouldn’t listen. You could see it was moving a kilometre a week and they wanted us to go 3 kilometres from the outside. And we said it should have been 5 kilometres from the outside and work back in the way. And you could have put a firebreak in because there was a bit down beside near Cockermouth, and there had been a case in Cockermouth, but there was a space of something like 2 and a half-mile from the last case to that case which they classed as clean ground  in between. They wouldn’t let us cross it. But after 3 week, it joined up. If they had let us in and taken the 3km ring round about it chances are it wouldn’t have ‘gotten’ in, it wouldn’t have got round the ring.  They wouldn’t listen. They were telling us where we had to go and that was it.

They being DEFRA?

Yes. They were saying, what they called the firebreak, which was outside, and we had farmers from Wigton, Aspatria, screaming for us to go and pick the sheep up and we couldn’t and you couldn’t tell them, “ I’m sorry I’m not allowed to.”  That wasn’t. I mean they were trying to inform DEFRA why. They basically wanted outside the firebreak in, forget about the people in the middle, as far as they were concerned, it were gone. They didn’t care, but we were the ones that were stuck in the middle of it.

I was going to say, in that 5 weeks, did you come across some bad feeling?

Aye.

Not that it was directed at you but unfortunately you were there weren’t you?

Well, I mean you got the brunt of it. If you were willing to sit and listen to them. DEFRA, you just couldn’t get through to DEFRA. Try phoning DEFRA and they didn’t know. We had one man, near T, he blocked himself in with combines and he was going to shoot himself and shoot anybody that came any where near him, because we wouldn’t lift the sheep because we weren’t allowed to go in to the middle. 

And that story hasn’t got out has it? Because that’s very interesting that people would act in that way?

It will never get out because who is going to believe it and that’s the truth. Who’s going to believe it because it is covered up with bureaucracy. 

But lots of people ------

They do but DEFRA just deny it. They won’t admit to something like that. But everybody knew, the farmers and everybody knew.  They said that DEFRA just wouldn’t listen to anybody local with local knowledge. They wouldn’t listen to them. 

So local knowledge just wasn’t used?

It was eventually but just in small doses. You couldn’t tell them. I mean they were telling us coming up to the fifth week, we knew ourselves we were well through, we’d got nearly every farm lifted that we could and DEFRA were coming in saying, “ well there’s another half a million sheep out there.”  They built a new shed at Orton, another killing shed. Brand new shed. Put it up. It was never used, because they were out with helicopters looking for sheep because they thought that this other half million sheep was there, but this was like in May in lambing time. They were going on figures in June from two year previous, which there would be that many more sheep, because all the ewes were lambed then and  the lambs would still be running about, but try to tell them, they just wouldn’t have it. They built this shed. I don’t know how many thousand to put this shed up and it was never used.

And so during that five weeks, during the cull, were you just basically working with the army, or did you have contact with MAFF, DEFRA?

Well, when you could get a hold of them, which was very little. We were basically left to get on with it. Yes, we worked with the army I mean.. D. was obviously in the full operation, basically on the live site. So he was down to Carlisle every night in the ‘Ops room’ [?Central Control]  to see what was going on and what they wanted of us the next day. We were like working two days ahead of ourselves. If we were picking sheep up on a Sunday, the farmers were all phoned and primed on a Friday night. We were two days ahead of ourselves all the time. So he was going and getting the figures. They would say right, “ we want 12000 sheep into Carlisle on Sunday and we want 14000 sheep into Great Orton.” It was a case of get on with it. Just do it.

And on the ground was it working?

It was working. We phoned them 2 days before, let them know what was going on, roughly what time we would be in for the sheep and we ‘hed’ three teams of lads ‘wit’ dogs and mobile pens and if anybody was on their own and going to be struggling to get them in, we would send the lads with the dogs and the pens in to help them. And they would maybe do, one man would do four or five farms a day, with the dogs and pens.

So you were incredibly organised weren’t you really? It must have been very difficult at first was it?

At first it was because we had the meeting on a Monday night and on the Tuesday we set the office up but I mean money talks. We had telephone systems, computers, everything in place by Tuesday night, because we were basically told whatever it takes get it. So money talks and everyone knew that the Government was paying. Oh yes they’re looking for computers and we had the office set up and running on Tuesday night.

That’s incredible.

Well, it was there and we could start. I wouldn’t say it was up and running but we could start. We were upside down. We didn’t know how we were going to work it. We just, the first three or four days, we set the system up and got it up and running, we went at it. But the first week or so we were supposed to pick 2000 on one night Wednesday and up it to 4000 on the Thursday and then 6000 and then up to 10,000 within a week. We were on 11,000 the second day.

And that’s just because you could get all these wagons and…

Well, we already had the wagons but they just threw it at us. Right you’ve got it.

We are talking a hell of a lot of livestock there aren’t we? That’s huge isn’t it?

Aye, if you take somewhere like, I don’t know, Hesket Newmarket area, you go in one day and it will be empty by night. Just go in and maybe 40 or 50 farms a day and clear a full area out in one go.

Yes, because when you say lifted, it isn’t always straight forward is it? 

A lot of the farms, if they had dairy cattle, they didn’t want the wagons anywhere near the farms steadings so you were loading them through a field gateway, away from the farm which you’ve got to respect them for wanting that.

Yes, were you working with dogs?

We were working with dogs and pens and just whatever means.

Was that easy? I mean you make it sound easy don’t you, you say you just lift them but I mean for the people that don’t know anything about it, they don’t realise.

It’s possible, I mean we still do, I mean we’re maybe, we get, I don’t know, six different auction companies and we get the fax through with 3000 sheep on it, from Berwick down through the Lake District and around to Hexham and we have to work out the loads, plan the loads so the wagons are not travelling too far and go and lift them off farms. And we go and ring the farmers and tell them what time they are going to be there, but we always give them 24, 48 hours notice if we can so that the sheep are ready for when the wagon gets there. 

So in a way, it is part of your skills anyway. What we were saying about your experience, but it takes a lot of skills doesn’t it?

The lads that worked in the office were, I mean they were hand picked for the job. Cool headed lads that knew the local area, knew the way the job worked, knew the way the livestock worked, but mainly because they were cool headed and they knew how to talk to people because just…..[pause].

So you need all that skill. You need a lot of local knowledge because presumably you know a lot of people when you are going onto farms?

You do I mean, I learned more about the local area when we done that, than I ever knew before. I didn’t realise, I mean, a lot of the sheep on the farms belonged to people in Wales, Yorkshire.

That’s interesting.

Sheep that was up for wintering. And a lot of these they were dairy farms that had taken a lot of sheep on for wintering and they wanted them off.

That’s interesting isn’t it?

And there was thousands and I mean thousands, of sheep that were on farms, that didn’t belong to them farmers.

And that is something again that people outside of farming don’t always think about. 

Well, that was, that was a lot of the movements we didn’t realise went on. On little farm vehicles and they take them there themselves for wintering and fetch a little wagon up and have a weekend with the farmers and they’d drop the sheep off and away they go and . . . . ., we picked a hundred and forty or a hundred and fifty rams up off one farm.

Rams?

Rams, and it was a fellow from probably Kirkby Stephen area that had organised them in to this fellow at ‘Spatria and this fellow at ‘Spatria hadn’t a clue who’s the rams were. All he had was this contact number and when we got to the bottom of it, there was about 70 different owners of these rams. 
He gathers them all up. He goes and gathers them all up and then he fetches them for wintering.

Right. 

And there was about 70 different owners.

Good grief.

So all that was like, you had 70 different owners, 70 evaluations, 70 lots of paperwork.

What a nightmare. That’s unusual though is it?

We went to another farm and we lifted 2000 sheep and they ‘hed’ about  9 different owners all on keep, all on winter keep. There’s a lot of that.

But I mean it’s another source of income isn’t it?

Oh it is aye, it is, I mean they wanted farmers to diversify so this is it. So if they had grass in the winter, they took sheep on.

But it just makes you wonder about the surprise at the level of animal movement because you start thinking about what goes on in the industry, it should not be such a surprise should it?

It shouldn’t be. It shouldn’t, no, but they didn’t.  They just didn’t realise how it, I mean, they just couldn’t believe in 8 to10 hours, how sheep got to Longtown from Devon, but it happens.

And it happens quickly?

 I mean, when my Dad first started driving, it used to take them 17 hours to come from Thurso [Scotland] to Longtown. They had blankets on their legs to keep warm and 7 and half, 8 hours driving now and you’ve got a load of sheep from Thurso  to Longtown, because you have vehicles that are that much better, you have roads that are that much better. Your livestock carrying vehicles are that much better, but I mean they used to come with maybe 300 sheep whereas the size of the wagons nowadays is like they can put 600 on. 

It’s a much bigger business isn’t it? 

It is, aye.

So after that 5 weeks of the very intensive contiguous cull where you were taking out all the sheep, I mean what was happening after that?

Things were starting to happen. They were allowing movements again, licensed movements but at that time, it was towards August then so it was.  . .the lads were on holidays and you were getting your holidays in and covering for holidays and things was moving slowly. I wouldn’t have said, they was going in the height, we had 20 to 22 we had all of our own livestock vehicles and 6 other contractors on full time for us. Then we went down to maybe 6 or 8 moving but a lot of the lads were away on general haulage and so it was just if and when stuff was to move, but I mean once the holidays and that were over, it got into September time going back into March when it first come out, a lot of them first farms were clean and ready for restocking because they were clean, and they were ready for restocking then so its slowly started moving into, because the last case was in September, so most farms were in the process of being cleaned then and a lot of the first farms then, most of them farms were clean and they were looking for livestock then. They wanted back into work. 

So in terms of you, because I know what you are saying D., that you work long hours anyway but I mean presumably this was very unusual? What was happening for you personally? In terms of your home life, your health and general sort of feelings about the cull?

Well, you didn’t have a home life. You didn’t have any. We were working up to hundred and ten, hundred and fifteen hours a week, seven days a week. We did ‘heve’ days off but you were loathe to take a day off because you just felt that it had to be done. If you were taking a day off, it was putting pressure on the rest of the lads in the office, because we ‘hed’ six telephones in the office, six or seven telephones in the office plus our mobiles and they rang solid for 12 to 14 hours a day. It just never stopped. I was using 3 to 4 batteries a day on the mobile phone, just answering calls. Absolutely crazy, but I mean it wasn’t until afterwards when M. said when D. [10 year old son]was coming down for the weekend, and I was just never thinking, not asking M. if she could cope with D. being there. Just you know getting up and going to work. 

You said like a robot almost aren’t you?

Well, you are. You come home at night, you have your tea and a shower, you went to bed, you got up the next morning and you went to work but you weren’t sleeping right because your head was…. Your mind was going all the time, because you were , “oh I’ve got this, I have to do this and these sheep tomorrow, that’s to do and then I’ve got to do this”,  but you do sleep because you come home and you ‘hed’ to but even there when you come home, I mean the smell around her for 3 or 4 week was absolutely terrible.

You were right in the middle of things really?

Well, there was 5 pyres all burning at the same within a quarter mile radius of Longtown. I mean I got up one morning and the smell in the house was terrible, and I thought it was foggy outside. I opened the back door, thinking to let the smell out and it was worse. It was smoke swirling around the houses. Because it was a calm morning, you would think it was thick dense fog. And it was stinking, it was horrible and we had that for three or four week, because they used the wrong coal on the pyres. They were building the pyres wrong. They weren’t burning properly and some of them pyres burned for 6 and 7 week.

So what did you think of the meetings at L, you know, the sort of public meetings, where people had their say?

Well, it was a waste of space because it was the same ones, the same ‘out-of towners’, as we call the, the ones that have never worked in their lives, coming in shouting for compensation and not the ones that counted. But it doesn’t matter if you were at a meeting, you always get the wrong ones that do the shouting.

That’s interesting.

You don’t. You never seem to get the right. It’s the same as these debates on the television, you always seem to get the wrong ones answering the questions and asking questions. They never seem to get the right people. 

So it attracted the wrong sort of people anyway?

Well, anybody that it did involved were working trying to put it right so the only ones that were left, was the ones that were, should I say unemployable. They went and done the shouting because they couldn’t get a job doing anything.

That’s interesting.

Because anyone that did . . . . ., your farm workers it affected, your farmers, hauliers, auction staff, they were all working. They didn’t have time to go to the meetings. So it was all the wrong people that they were listening to. 

So do you think anything good came out of foot and mouth? If not for you but long term for Cumbria?

Not really no. Yes there was a lot of money injected into the county but as far as I can see, a lot of the farmers did play on it. Good luck to them. I mean, I bought a new car out of the money that I made. As far as I am concerned I worked fro every penny of it.

But you worked?

I worked for every penny of it. a lot of folks say that it was there to be made and anybody who didn’t make it, but you need to be paid for doing something like that. 

And you kept saying to me that it was a job that had to be done?

That was the feeling, aye. It, I mean if they ‘hedn’t’, if we ‘hedn’t’ had taken them sheep up live, what would ‘heve’ happened? What sort of mess would it have got in? Because they couldn’t keep up with the dead carcasses. There were carcasses laid up that road there for nearly three weeks. If them sheep hadn’t gone live and into those pits at [Great] Orton, what would have happened? Especially the way it was, I mean, we knew it was, in the third week we had 3 or 4 wagons parked up for a week, and the lads put into isolation because they got farms where the sheep had foot and mouth. Because you knew it was there. What sort of mess would this country have been in if them sheep hadn’t have been taken out? 

What about, do you think that MAFF caused any sort of friction that perhaps is still there amongst different groups of people? 

It did. It caused a lot of bad feeling because a lot of the rules and regulation were stupid then and are still stupid now, are still in place. I mean the market for instance, has a public entrance and a livestock entrance. The land rovers and trailers used to empty in the, what we call the public entrance. They still won’t let them use it. So the traffic can queue into the middle of the town on a Thursday, but yet, I can walk across the road from our yard and I can walk into the market, I can go into the sale ring, I can go into the office, I can go right through every pen in the market, walk out into where the livestock wagons are and then walk back out, jump in the car and go to Carlisle market if I want, so what’s the difference between a land rover going in and emptying his sheep and going back out again. Because he has got to go 30 yards down the road into the other entrance to wash his trailer. 

And is that because you are there kind of working with it whereas you feel that those that are making the rules, they don’t understand how you work in practice? 

Well, one of the things that came out of this meeting last week in Bedford that D was at , one thing that come up was these washes and D. said DEFRA must be finally listening to someone, they have got their heads out of their arses and they can hear them now, which is true. They haven’t got a clue. I mean at first, if I took a load of sheep into Longtown, I had to wash me hands in a different hand basin than a farmer, but then I could go and sit in the canteen and have my dinner with him. Still with my leggings on and I could take a load of sheep into Longtown, empty it and as long as I fill a piece of paper in I could drive that wagon dirty to Devon before I washed it, but I wasn’t allowed to wash my hands in the same wash hand basin as a farmer. Where is the sense in that? 

So what does that leave you feeling about the Government in terms of how they are handling livestock movements now? 

I think this Government stinks basically. Because Tony Blair has done the same with the firemen as he has done with foot and mouth. He put Nick Brown into. . . ., when foot and mouth come in, he held him back and then when he stepped in and said right I’m taking over, it doesn’t matter what it costs, get on and do it. Poor old Nick Brown was shoved in the corner and forgotten about and he’s done exactly the same with the firemen. He has taken over now, he’s not giving in to them and he has done exactly the same but now, eighteen month, two year down the line, they are still coming wanting money back. It doesn’t matter what it cost to do it at the time, but two year down the line, unbeknown to the public, “oh yes we’ll put the money in just whatever it costs, sort it out.” They are coming and wanting the money back now. 

How is that? In terms of checking hours?

Well saying that, I mean when the lads, because their wagons were classed as clean and going into clean farms, the lads weren’t even allowed to open their cab windows, when they were in Orton. They had to hold a sign up at the window to say what livestock they had in the wagon, so they are saying they want an hour a day back off every wagon and every member of staff for dinners. 


[tape turned over]

And that’s what they were saying.  They wanted an hour a day back off the drivers because they were stopping for lunch.  They couldn’t even get out of the wagon.  How can that be classed as ‘heving’ a lunch break when they couldn’t even get out of the wagon and when they left [Great] Orton, they couldn’t stop anywhere.  I mean that’s them.  They were accusing us of all sorts. I mean we had three men, just by coincidence called John Watson.  They were saying we only had one and we were charging them for three. 
If we had two stampers [?]’ wagons for instance and they had very similar registrations, they were say there was only one and we want that money back off you.

So there were all sorts. . . .

. . . .Oh they didn’t want nothing to start with. They didn’t want no records, they weren’t going to count lamb. They were just going to count adult sheep. “Get them off the ground, get them in the haulier.“ That’s what they wanted.  But because we’ve always, because of law, we’ve always kept records.  We set a system up. We put a database in, everything went onto paperwork.  They come afterwards and they wanted all that.  If we hadn’t kept a record, what sort of a mess would we have been in? They’ve no record of the tippers because they never kept any records. It was just a case of get the job done, get it cleaned up.  But because we’ve got records, we’re basically getting persecuted for it. They keep coming back wanting more and it’s all there, there’s nothing to hide.  But they said the valuations was just to be done on adult sheep so they done that. And then afterwards they says, “where’s the evaluations for the lambs ”, because they wanted to know how many lambs went into the pit at [Great] Orton.  There were some farmers’ cheques was, well if they maybe ‘hed’, well for instance L (farm) had 11 000 sheep running about. There was one farmer over at Maryport had nearly 5000 sheep.  His cheque was nearly 150 000 (£) light ‘cos what they done was, well if the lambs was ready to go, they valued the lambs, but they didn’t want any counts for the lambs, they just wanted adult sheep, so we didn’t know what had been valued and what hadn’t.  So they were taken the six highest valued animals, which if they had a ram valued at £10 000, if they had 6 of them at £10 000 pounds that was £60 000 they took off them for a lamb that was maybe worth £40, £45 and then for the rest of the sheep they just took an average off them.  Just sent them the cheque light. We spent two and a half, nearly three month afterwards trying to sort all that out.  We had letters off vets, farmers, movement records, witnesses to say that them sheep was there, auctioneers.  We had to prove to Defra that  them sheep were there. It’s like kicking someone when they’re down.

Very final question and thank you. It’s a question we ask everyone and it’s about the future of farming in Cumbria?

After this week, I don’t know, N announcing they’ve pushed farmers into building big parlours and big tanks for three day milk collection and then they just drop them. 

A conversation ensues about local versus national and international markets.  Interviewer thanks PM for his time.

The weather has improved somewhat this week, so I was able to get outside more. It was disheartening to sit in the office waiting for telephone enquiries etc that are far and few between at the moment. One piece of good news is there is someone interested in a season pitch. We don’t make as much money for there, but is a guaranteed income - a bird in the hand etc
	I went into Carlisle on Monday to sort out brochures for this season. Living at O has made me appreciate peace and quiet, so a trip even to a small city like Carlisle drives me mad and I can’t wait to get back home. It was nice to see sheep back in the fields around Longtown. Rather ironic that you notice them as something ‘out of place’. I think of this time last year when it was all just beginning and ‘can’t believe it’s’ only a year. It seems like this area has been devastated for so long. Perhaps the long winter is due to no proper ‘farming’ seasons. Funny how we take things for granted.
	The planning permission for the house was applied for this week. I got a letter from our neighbour Mr. F advising that the line we hope to build on may be silt. There are restrictions on where we can build from MOD, so don’t have much choice. I went over to the farm to have a chat with the F’s about it. This is the first time I have had a long conversation with the older Mr. F since F.M.D and I didn’t know what to say. He looked beaten when I saw him shortly after they took their animals, so it was nice to see him look on form so to speak. They are such a nice family, we’re lucky to have them as neighbours.
	WF has agreed to come over next week to go over what land was used for before which should be helpful. The details for the new electricity supply came but are not very helpful. Our intention was to renew the supply and hook – up points for the caravans. As we had virtually no business last year the funds aren’t there to cover it. The quote for the hook-ups is around the £7 –8 K mark and I was expecting half of that. When the quote came in at another £8, 000 I couldn’t believe it. £16 000 is a lot of touring caravans. We need the work done, the supply part is urgent, but I don’t know where the money will come from. A few months ago I applied for the interest relief part of the Rural Recovery Fund grant and got a letter back saying it had been approved, so I hoped to use this money for electricity. I then got a letter saying the original letter had been a mistake and I couldn’t have the money after all. I feel really angry that a new business, one man band painting ceramics figures, gets a grant of £15 000 to counter the effects of foot and mouth and we got £8 000. It isn’t that I’m not grateful for the money we have received, it just doesn’t seem fair. I’m having a difficult time persuading people to come here, as soon as they hear Longtown mentioned I can hear the change in tone. I have to impress those who do come and it will be difficult if the species aren’t up to scratch. As a whole, the site is stunning, perfect peace, good walks and plenty of wildlife, but all that will mean nothing if their lights fuse when they get back to their caravans. I’m going to telephone David Thornley from Cumbria Chamber of Commerce, who is our business link advisor to see if he can suggest anything.
	We have one full time and one part time staff here and it has crossed my mind that maybe this we have to be where the savings are made, but I can’t do it. Linda is a single mum of two teenage lads who works three jobs to make ends meet. How can I say I can’t afford the £27 she takes home? I know she’s worried, she must have noticed how we’ve tried to cut back on everything else.
	Part of the grant we did get went on advertising in the fishing magazines (caravan magazines are too expensive at the moment) and we get a reasonable response from them. I’ve sent out 24 brochures this week and have one booking for the static caravan later in the year from that batch. I’m hoping it’s just that people are delaying booking. I need to send out the letters for season pitches soon and I’m dreading any of them telling me they won’t renew this year. They have been very patient with the work that needs done but they won’t wait forever. Part of the cash flow problem arises because they pay their pitchers in April, so we have that money then, but they also want to start using their caravans then, so the work has to be done beforehand. Whatever gave me the idea that this venture would be less stressful than running a shop?

Week Number: 2
Diary

Despite a fairly promising start, this week has been pretty depressing really. Still reasonable numbers of enquires but not many bookings. I have tried to be outside as much as possible as sitting in the office just reminds me of unpaid bills, no bookings etc. At least if I’m outside I can remind myself why we’re doing this in the first place.
	I had an interesting conversation with F on Wednesday discussing the compensation farmers had received. His daughter is married to a family who have three farms, all of which lost animals of very high pedigree. The resulting compensation amounted to almost £1 million for farm, fair enough I thought. He then went on to tell me that this same family had claimed relief from the Community Recovery Fund as well. I’m totally flabbergasted. That recovery fund should surely be for the benefit of those related to farming who have struggled through the last year. Farm workers who have lost their jobs, or people whose livelihood depended on the farms. Given the amount of paperwork involved in these things, I would have thought someone would be checking the validity of the claims.    
	Things went from bad to worse on Friday when I read the local paper. A pull out section on farming gave details of no less than four different schemes to help farmers overcome foot and mouth related loss of business, all of which involve grant funding of some description. One or two seemed as if they might be relevant to us from a conservation point of view, but when I contacted them, they only apply to farms. Maybe I’m missing something somewhere. I can’t seem to find anyone remotely interested in helping our type of business.
	Despite that, we have started making plans for the future of the site. We’ve listed all the things that involve time rather than money and will make a start on them. Somewhere down the line, money will be needed, but I’ve got enough on at the moment so I’ll deal with those when they arise.
	Family life hasn’t been too good this week. We’re all feeling the strain of being in the caravan and the really poor weather this week, coupled with the half term holiday has added to the pressure. I’m awfully tired at the moment, even though I’m averaging seven hours sleep a night. S doesn’t sleep very well anyway and I used to say it’s because he worried about things he can’t change. Now I’m not so sure. I’ve fallen asleep in the afternoon a couple of times this week, which makes me annoyed because there is so much to do around here. I just can’t get motivated at the moment. I don’t consciously go to bed with things on my mind and I’m not aware that I’m ‘dreaming’ of problems, but I don’t wake up feeling refreshed like I use to.
	Longtown auction mart opened again this week and seemed to be really busy which is a good sign. An article in the Cumberland News reported figures for the Tourist Information Board showing visitors for Carlisle, Brampton and Longtown offices fell from 35 000 to 23 000 compared with previous year. I hope that isn’t a sign of things to come.
	I am still no closer to solving the problems we have with regard to the facilities on site. I had a call from Business Link telling me that I still had around £900 of our marketing grant to claim. We haven’t, so I know they’ve made a mistake but I was tempted to send a claim form anyway. Part of what really gets me down about the grant system in the fact that they don’t seem to keep track of anything so I’m left thinking are we being told there’s no money available because they’ve paid out twice over.
	There’s talk in Longtown of a herd in Cumbria or the North East being slaughtered in the last few weeks because antibodies were found in the sheep. I checked on the DEFRA website and couldn’t find any information so I have to assume it is just talk, because the other alternative doesn’t bear thinking about. We can’t survive a season with no tourists again.
	I’ve outlined a letter for our season pitch holders, due to go out in early march. We’ve decided to leave the fees as they are this year, partly to compensate for them not being able to use their vans last year and because we haven’t been able to do any upgrades. If all of them renew it will help the cash flow a little, so I’m hoping.
	The fishing should pick up shortly, so with a few good catches reports in the angling papers we might get more business for the next few months.
	I’ve just read back through this and realised how pessimistic it all sounds. Perhaps for future diaries I should take a walk around the site first, a few bullfinches, voles, deer and rabbits would put things in perspective. 

Week Number: 3
Diary

	I’ve been disappointed with myself this week. When I read over last weeks diary, I made up my mind to start afresh this week and start being positive, but it hasn’t happened. I’m sure there are times in everyone’s life when things just seem to conspire against you despite your best efforts. I had to renew the planning permission for our static caravans which meant multiple forms and maps to send. I didn’t have OS maps so I phoned the planning department and a nice lady there said not to worry, no details had changed so she would copy the maps they had from last time, so I duly sent the forms and fee. I received a letter two days later telling me the application is invalid because there are no maps with it.
	Business link also sent me a letter telling me I should apply for the interest relief part of the recovery fund. This is the same grant that they’ve been ‘processing’ for almost six weeks and still haven’t paid me. These things seem small in the great scheme of life, but I can’t express how angry they make me. As a normally laid back person, these feelings are strong.
	There was a suspected case of FMD in Yorkshire this week. This one was reported on television rather than being ‘rumoured’ so it had a much greater effect. Part of me wishes they wouldn’t report these things nationally as for a few hours I was taken back to last year and sitting by the radio waiting to hear who had gone down next and praying it wasn’t any of my neighbours. I think the mere mention of the disease strikes total fear these days. Fortunately it didn’t take too long for the ‘all clear’ on this Yorkshire front. Or as clear as it can be with their initial tests.
	  Reading through the local paper gives one perhaps a clearer view of the big picture in the area at present. The property pages are filled with farms for sale and dispersal sales. In some ways, I can’t blame farmers for getting out, who would want the heartbreak all over again? All those years of building up stock, to be wiped out in a matter of days. From a more selfish point of view, I hope they stay in farming because all the ones for sale won’t be kept as farms. They’ll be turned into holiday venues and tourist accommodation, more competition in an already struggling market.
	It occurred to me this week that I’m smoking more than I ever have before despite my mother’s illness and my resolve to cut down and stop last June. It just never seems like a good time. I’ll have to set a date and make a concentrated effort soon. Maybe once the season kicks off and there are a few less financial worries.
	Family wise things came to a head this week with my fourteen year old son informing us that he’ll leave home when he’s sixteen. Apparently he hates living here and wishes we were back in Penrith. I know that much of this stems from us being cooped up in caravan, but it’s difficult to explain why. He sees things in a very simplistic way – we sold the house in Penrith, so why don’t we have the money to build a new one? I don’t want them worried about our money situation so although I’ve explained that things will be tight for a while, I haven’t given them the full picture. To be £20 000 short in a season seems like it should be such a small matter but it can mean the difference between survival or not.
	I’m starting to prepare for the coming season regards to information available etc. I’ve done new posters for TICs (Tourist Information Centres) and local pubs etc so I’ll put them in next week. I’m going to make a list of all the things I can do that don’t cost anything and get on promoting what I can. Fishing reports etc to the angling papers can bring enquires so I’ll try that. As usual I’m somewhat frustrated by the knowledge that if people would visit, they’d fall in love with the place like we did, but short of physically forcing them to come I don’t know how else to persuade them. Another walk for inspiration I think.

Week Number: 4
Diary

	Despite some awful weather I have spent most of this week outside trying to get on with things that take up time rather than money. I’ve avoided the paperwork as much as possible since it always seems to bring more bad news of one kind or another.
	Last weeks blow out family wise seems to have at least cleared the air a little, so there has been a relative peace. My husband is finally having two days a week off work, so he if can relax a little things may get better. The difficulty in working for oneself is that there’s little in the way of social life so things get strained, and in our case we tend to blame each other for things not being done. Same old story, I think I have too much to do, he thinks he has. At times we work against each other instead of pulling together. Financial problems exacerbate this problem, so it’s important that we spend time sorting it out.
	This means of an inquiry into FMD in Cumbria is a mixed blessing I think. It is important that people have their say and lessons are learnt, but the bigger picture needs to be looked at. Time and money spent going over out mistakes perhaps takes away from action to prevent these mistakes recurring. Going over the past doesn’t necessarily help for the future. It seems to me that the question of what should be happening now to help businesses recover is far more important that what we should have been happening last year. It’s too late to change the events of last year but not too late to help with this one.
	It was interesting to learn that Radio 4 had shown awareness of this study. Much of my frustration stems from the feeling of being ‘left to get on with it’. It’s difficult to find someone to talk to without feeling that I am adding to their burned or that they won’t understand. Those that do understand are in a similar position ourselves so it isn’t fair to load more on. I think just to have the feeling that someone had listened and taken our feelings seriously would make all the difference. The frustration of having to battle our way through paperwork, getting no information unless we find it ourselves and continually having to make the first move would be worth it if we felt someone was listening. I suppose that’s what I think this study will achieve, which is why I agreed to do it.
	General enquires seem to have slowed a little ? despite the good fishing weather. I’ve put out our catch reports in a number of angling papers and in the local paper which comers out on a Friday so maybe we’ll get more action over the weekend. I have been looking for a caravan late in the year from a woman who visited at the end of last year. It’s nice when people can understand what we’re trying to do and appreciate that it takes time.
	We are due for a visit from the B.H.9.H.P.A Bellamy Award assessor soon. Although we achieved Gold last year, they did comment on the appearance of the car park entrance. We haven’t had the funds to do the necessary work on this yet, so I’m hoping they will make allowances. Gold on our first attempt was excellent, but won’t be easy to maintain unless the season picks up.
	We need some good free publicity so I’m making enquires at the moment to find out what events are planned in Longtown for the Golden Jubilee holiday, to see if we can tie in something with it.  Getting local people involved isn’t easy, a through back to the problems we had in our first year. The court case for that is due to take place in June (if it isn’t postponed again) so maybe after that we can start again.

Week Number: 5
Diary

	I have sent out the letters for renewal of season pitches and have asked that they let me know as soon as possible if they won’t be renewing this year. I’ve only had four out of the fifteen possibles confirm that they will stay, which is a bit worrying. There is still time, deadline in 7th April, so it may be that some have been too busy to reply.
	I have bookings for two of the statics next week, both also interested in fishing so we may be seeing some income there. At least the weather seems to be picking up a little. We’ve actually had some sunshine this week. Wednesday was glorious, which was good timing as we had a Countryside Stewardship Advisor visit. He had a good look around and reckons we may be eligible for new fencing and hedging grants. We had wanted to turn our field into a hay meadow and although he agreed it was a good idea, condition of the grant involves grazing it for a few months each year. That means buying sheep or allowing another farmer to put sheep in, with all the associated dangers. A report in the Cumberland News this week reckons FMD could hit just as hard again at present, as the safety measures aren’t up to scratch yet.  If we put sheep on and it starts all over again, we’ll be finishes. We couldn’t survive another season like last year. And if we had sheep ourselves, we’d have to close as they wouldn’t allow caravans or anglers onto the land. We’ll leave the decision until the last minute. The application is to be in at the end of May so we still have a little time. The advisor was optimistic about the site in all other ways, so it is nice to have some positive feedback.
	We’re getting quite a lot of grief from the anglers at the moment as they have started fishing again after the winter break.  The work that should have been carried out last year is still on hold until we get some money in, so they’re not very pleased. Five had said they won’t be buying tickets this year. We did get some coverage in the Cumberland News for last week’s catch details and that seems to have sparked some interest from day ticket anglers. Five season tickets is still a big chunk of our income though – I need 80 day tickets to make up. Praying for good weather and big fish is daily routine.
	We’ve taken out a loan to buy a mini digger to try to do some of the heavier work around the site. Hiring and digger and driver is too expensive and at least this way have something to sell at the end of it. I’m hoping we can do some of the work for the new electric’s ourselves to bring the cost down. It will take us longer that a professional but we don’t have an option really.
	Chris from the bank has sent a gentle reminder about pension planning and writing wills. I know its something we need to sort out but the timing isn’t great. At the rate we’re going we’ll be working ‘till we’re eighty and won’t have anything to leave anyway.
	There was a public meeting in Carlisle this week with the agenda ‘lessons to be learn from FMD outbreak’. I went along but it seemed to be the same old people saying the same old things so I didn’t stay very long. The only way we’ll know if the lessons have been learned is if, God forbid, there’s another outbreak. I still don’t think there’s any point in looking back. Far better to spend the time (and money) helping people through today. Again, a small voice that isn’t heard.

Week Number: 6 
Diary

	Weather has been vast improvement this week and seems to have lifted everyone’s spirits. There is so much work to do around the site its difficult to know where to start. We have a digger at last so we can start on some of the heavier work.
	There have been plenty of inquires for next weekends Easter holiday so hopefully we should be quite busy. More of the season tourers have confirmed that they would like to stay so we should be able to balance out cash flow a bit better in April. I still haven’t heard from the Planning Department about renewal of permission for the statics which is a bit worrying. We had hoped these would provide a good income this year. Ideally we’d like to sell the ones we have and replace them owner occupied holiday homes from which we would get a sit rent. Last season has made us very aware of how vulnerable we are to trends and setbacks. The problem is that the Planning Department have set conditions on the site license and whereby we have to own and let the static caravans which means we have no actual guaranteed income from one month to the next on the site. It makes forward planning very difficult, we’re nervous after last season. I’m thinking it might be worth hiring a ‘Planning Consultant’ to try to vary the conditions. I’ve got the distinct impression that ‘who you know’ plays a very big part in planning decisions.  
	I’ve spoken to one of our season tourers this week for the first time since her husband died two months ago. It’s very difficult to know what to say, but it does tend to put life into perspective. Here is a 39 year old man suddenly taken and leaving a family of four children and his wife totally devastated. Makes your realize that life is too short to sweat the small stuff. The worst that could happen to us is that we lose our business and home. We drive ourselves to the point of exhaustion, constantly worrying about the future when in fact, its out of our hands.
	There has been a national campaign to promote carvanning and an effort to improve the image of those who take touring caravans on the road. I have to admit that before we bought O, my only knowledge of touring vans was what I remembered from a holiday to Skegness with my Granny thirty odd years ago. Its changed a bit since then Anything that brings us more business is very welcome anyway. Now all I have to hope for is that the anti hunt campaigners don’t turn their attention to fishing.
	The Cumberland News produced a supplement titled “Cumbria’s Story” this week with a sub heading ‘from chaos and tragedy to hope and recovery’. Reading through it and seeing the pictures brought it all back and I was a bit depressed again on Friday. The irony of being told it’s under control when all around people were losing theirs. The photo of a solitary lamb sleeping in a field oblivious to the pyres burning behind it is one of the most poignant I have ever seen. It quite simply summed it all up for me. There’s all the usual waffle from politicians, MAFF officials etc. and there’s this tiny lamb not knowing its fate. Towards the end of the paper there are the good news articles, people fighting back, recovering from the nightmare. Photos of smiling farmers at re-opened marts, trail hounds, Prince Charles staying at a local B&B. And still the picture of the lamb is the one that won’t leave my head.
	The paper reported that the slaughter man who killed his work mate during the crisis was found not guilty. Local opinions varies but the general consensus is that he was slightly annoyed and ‘mucking about’ with the gun at the time. One wonders at the balance of his mind, given the stresses of the job he was there to do, but I do feel sorry for the parents and girlfriend of the victim. 
	Our site is coming into its own now that spring seems to have arrived. I love walking around first thing in the morning when everything else is quiet. The sight of the sun coming up, over sheep in the fields, and hearing the bird’s sing is what makes it worthwhile. On mornings like this there is light at the end of the tunnel. I can forget the problems with electric’s, weed in the pond, hassle over grants etc and remember why we tool this on.
	The warmer weather makes everyone feel better in general and the kids don’t seem to be sniffing and wheezing as much as usual. S still looks tired, though, and it’s a pity a holiday is out of the question this year. WE may be able to get a few days at the end of the season. We’ll follow the example of our visitors and go somewhere in the UK. Devon was badly hit by FMD so maybe there. It’ll be nice if everyone thinks the same way and has at least a few days at home rather than abroad. Sunshine and cheap booze can be hard to compete with. Why people chose that over the stunning landscapes we have in this county is a total mystery to me, but I guess it would be boring if we were all the same. Good for business ‘tho’.
	Anyway, I’m looking forward to next weekend. It’ll be a good indicator for the year and if the Tourist Board predictions are accurate, we should have a busy weekend.

Week Number: 7 [28 – 3 – 02]
	The early part of this week was difficult. The kids are off school for Easter and quite rightly want to ‘do’ something. We haven’t the time or money, so it’s hard to explain to them. Their friends are going away for the weekend etc so they’re complaining about how unfair and boring their lives are, and they still have another week to go. I’m hoping I can persuade my mum to take them somewhere later in the year, or the summer holidays will be a total nightmare.
	The planning department have deferred our application for a house until they can have a legal agreement drawn up so that we can’t sell the house without the land and vice versa. It looks like we’ll be spending another winter in the caravan. I can’t bear to even think about it at the moment, and I haven’t told the kids – it would be the last straw.
	I ordered some flagstones this week to lay paths for the touring caravans. They were suppose to arrive on Tuesday, giving us time to get it done for the weekend but they won’t come until Saturday morning now, some problem with the haulier. Fortunately the weather has been great so far, so at least the ground has dried a bit.
	Most of the touring pitches are booked for the weekend, so if they all turn up, we should be busy. I’m concerned about the electrics playing up, but I can’t afford to turn business down, so I just have to hope for the best. A few more of our season tourers have confirmed for next year, so that’s good news. We have to get the work done on the pitches and electrics at the end of the season, though, or they won’t stay. Modern caravans are fully equipped – showers, heating etc – and the hook ups we have aren’t designed for them. Most people are understanding, but if it keeps tripping out when they all arrive at the weekend, it spoils their holiday and they won’t come back.
	Our regular visitors are commenting on how nice the site looks and how nice it is to see more visitors. They are genuinely pleased for us, and I’m reminded of how decent people can be. Longtown itself seems much busier this week, perhaps because of school holidays. The mood seems much lighter than it has been for sometime.
	I’ve read in the local paper that the inquiry on lessons to be learnt wants contributions from the public and business in general. I’m sorely tempted. If I thought for a minute that they’d actually listen and do something to help, I’d give them a ‘contribution’! I also read that a number of businesses have joined together in a class actions law suit against the government. It’s unlikely to progress before the end of next yer, by which time our business will be on the road to recovery or gone. If all this seems like inaction on my part, it isn’t. I’ve come to the conclusion that the only way to get through this is to forget last year and look forward. I have to accept that no-one is going to help, and I can’t keep banging my head against a brick wall. I have to come up with ways to recoup what we lost last year. The obvious solutions all involve changing the planning permission, which is our stumbling block.
	It’s been good to see more people on the site. The sun has been shining all week and everyone (apart from my kids) seems to be enjoying the break. I was supposed to go fishing with S on Wednesday evening but paperwork got the better of me. Maybe next week.

Week Number: 8
Diary

	We’ve had a really busy start to the week, with the Bank Holiday/Easter Weekend. All of the touring pitches were booked, which was fantastic to see. The weather was glorious apart from Monday so everyone really enjoyed the site. Our hard work is bringing benefits at last as people start to appreciate the natural beauty of the site with regard to wildlife etc. Reed buntings are starting to appear and I had a woodpecker at the bird feeders for the first time this year.
	My faith in people has been restored this week. Even though their payment isn’t due until May, most of the season tourers paid this week, saying they understood how difficult it had been last year etc. I haven’t had any of them so far say they didn’t want to renew which is great. I’m hoping this week has been a good indicator for the rest of the season. The lakes are fishing reasonably well and the weather is forecast to hold for a bit longer, maybe put people in a holiday booking mood.
	The kids still on school holidays but at least the weather has meant they can be outside. I took them to Carlisle on Wednesday to get a few summer clothes. It cheered [daughter] up but the boys couldn’t care less really. [son] had asked for new trainers but the ones he wanted are £80, which just can’t be done right now. I didn’t want to get into that old argument so I’ve agreed to think about if he does some work around the place.
	I had a call from the company we asked to quote for renewing hook-up points to see if we want to go ahead. I can’t see how we can do without the work being done, but I can’t find the money to upgrade the supply either, and we can’t have one without the other. I’ve asked them to wait until the end of the season anyway.
	I finally got fishing on Tuesday, on the river Annian, which was great. Just a few hours break after the rush of the weekend, enough to recharge the batteries. Part of the river stretch that we lease goes through farmland, so it’s only just reopened, so the farmer is reasonably happy with that at present.
	S and I argued all day Tuesday, for no apparent reason. We are supposed to be planning a scheme for a Countryside Stewardship application whereby we get help to create a hay meadow, tree planting etc. I don’t know whether we’re both tired or whatever but we couldn’t agree on anything. The land entered is tied in for ten years, so it’s important that we get it right. I’m pretty hopeless at plotting maps etc so that didn’t help.
	My mother has telephoned to remind me of a wedding anniversary party I’m supposed to attend on Friday. I won’t have seen most of them for years so I want to go to catch up with what’s being happening. I’m very guilty of good intentions where family is concerned, and I promise to keep in touch but then get so wrapped  up in every day life, it just gets put off. I’m quite keen to do a family tree, so I’ll have a chance to get some information on that.


Week Number: 9
Diary

	I had a quiet start to the week which was probably just as well as I am totally exhausted. Driving distances seems to really takes it out of me these days. I decided to start on the paperwork for the year end wages which was fun! It’s one of those things where even though you know it has to be done, you keep putting it off. I keep telling myself to do subtotals etc weekly or monthly, but it never happens. Things were slightly more complicated by the fact that I had deferred payments last year during FMD, so I’m trying to balance out what was paid and when. For one awful moment I thought I was still due to pay over £3000, what a relief it was a miscalculation! I could, of course, get the accountants to do this, but it never seems o justify the cost. I suppose the good news from them is that we don’t have any tax to pay this year, I don’t know if I should be depressed about that or not. It wasn’t entirely unexpected, but it does bring home the fact that we’ve worked for nothing this year.
	A, our grounds man, hasn’t been very well this week, bronchitis, I think. It’s worrying to see him struggle on, but he won’t hear of going off sick. It comes down to different work ethics of generations and a sense of loyalty. I know he feels grateful at been kept on last year event though we struggled to keep going. The truth is we would probably had to write this year off too if we’d let him go. There’s no way I could run the site on my own. It’s all about first impressions, and he works hard to make sure we give the right one. I’ve insisted he goes to the doctor at least.
	I went fishing on Thursday evening, which was nice. Didn’t catch anything but was able to watch the life around the lake without disturbing it at least. Our little brood of ducklings has shrunk from 14 to 7 – mink, I suspect.
	We worked on clearing an area at the corner of the lake which might be useful for picnic tables etc. Its fairly easy to reach and has a stunning view over the lake as the sun goes down. We won’t make any money from this kind of thing directly, but it may generate interest in the other aspects of the site. We realise we have to diversify somewhat, but I’m beginning to feel slightly discouraged by the lack if progress with the planning department. Ideally, we’d like to create something for everyone to run free of charge, but running costs have to be met somehow. It’s the usual vicious circle – can’t provide facilities without money and can’t generate money without facilities. Oh to be an assembly line worker!
	Our disabled angling group met for the first time this year on Sunday. This is a service we currently provide free of charge – use of the room, tea and coffee etc. In theory, it should pay us back by increasing the number of anglers and caravans we get, but it appears embroiled in petty politics at the moment, so nothing much comes out of it. I don’t want to get too involved in the running of it but things can’t stay as they are. It has to be mutually beneficial, for their group as much as our business.
	I’ve noticed a few adverts on television for local businesses in the last week. I’m assuming they’ve used their marketing grant for these, so I hope it pays off. There’s such a lot of competition at the moment. It will be interesting to see how the county marketing campaign works. I can’t help thinking that the Lake District pretty much sells itself. Who could fail to be attracted to such stunning scenery? I’m biased, but shouldn’t we be promoting the lesser known beauty of the whole area? I welcomed the news that the proposals for the Cumbria Rural Action Zone had been approved, only to read that a priority was looking into the viability of attracting cruise ships to the area. Am I mad? Are they? Who comes up with these ideas? The Haskins report recommended the focus be placed on viable businesses, those that had a proven record.  We find ourselves in a difficult position because we don’t have a record as such but we struggle on to prove ourselves. Isn’t there any help on the cards? I’m becoming more and more jaded by headlines hinting at help on the way then follow up stories about where the help will be directed.
	I’ve spent hours on the internet trawling through report after report trying to make some basic sense of it all. As usual it seems like time and money going on making things so much more complicated than they need to be, so I’ve given up on most occasions.

Diary

	I’ve had to take the dog to the vet this week and have been pretty devastated by the news she has cancer. He reckons he got most of it out but is fairly certain it has spread and given her age, he doesn’t recommend surgery. She’s twelve years old and we rescued her when she was seven. She has become such a big part of our lives, I can’t imagine being without her. Still the vet says she could last ages yet. She is very subdued at the moment, so I’m hoping she comes round a bit when the effects of surgery have worn off and she has the stitches taken out next week. The boys have taken it very hard, although not saying much.
	Being in a reflective mood, I went on the Internet to do some family tree stuff and found a sit for contacting old school friends. It was great to see so many names I recognised, brining back memories.  I contacted a few of them and was surprised by how far they’ve scattered. Cornwall, Newcastle, London even two in Canada. It’ll be nice to hear how life has gone for them after all the plans we made back then.
	I’ve had a couple of touring caravans on this week, one of them a couple who farmed at S thirty years ago. We had a long chat about how the area has changed since then. The following day they had visited old friends at Cochrane’s nursery, which adjoins our land. They had commented on how nice the site was and Cochrane’s had informed them of how it had all been done since we took over and how hard we worked. It’s good to hear other people recognize the efforts we make. The old couple even phoned their daughter in Arbroath to tell her to come down for the night. I wish I could bottle that type of publicity.
	I’ve been trying to get some more information on Rural Action Zone plan without success. I’ve heard whispers that there is money available for capital expenditure grants for affected businesses and was trying to find out if it might apply to our electricity upgrade. I’ll try DT at business link on Monday – maybe he’ll know. I’ve also read in the Cumberland News this week of further developments in the class action lawsuit. I have to admit, I can see where they’re coming from. Since the start of the outbreak, I’ve felt as if no one was listening to what we really needed, and it hasn’t changed any. Things come on the news etc and I feel like screaming at the sheer ignorance of it. It’s so difficult to get motivated when it fells like no ones listening anyway.
	Maybe this has just been a bad week, what with the dog and everything.

Week Number: 11
	L has been on holiday this week so I’ve busied myself doing the cleaning etc. It’s funny how you miss people being around. Even though she’s only part time she’s a big part of this place it seems strange without her.
	I worked in the shop on Wednesday as we also have a member of staff on holiday there, so S was on his own. He looks tired this week, doing seven days in the shop and then working here when he gets home. It’s difficult to see where we could cut down though, he has to push sales in the shop constantly since when he isn’t there our takings drop dramatically and since the shop is still funding O, we can’t afford to let that drop. Add to that his passion for giving good service, visiting ponds, dropping things off ‘on his way home’ etc, and it’s easy to see why he’s exhausted. Neither of us has taken up the health check we were notified about at the local surgery, which we maybe should. His is more important than mine, but he keeps saying he hasn’t the time. 
	The dog took a turn for the worse on Thursday, but she seems to be perking up a bit now. I can’t help thinking I’m being unfair to keep her going when she’s ill but I can’t let her go yet. The vet says she isn’t in pain at present but she looked so miserable on Thursday. I’m being selfish at the moment but I won’t let it go on if they tell me she’s suffering.
	Both of the ‘better’ statics are let this week and one next week, so at least we can pay the wages. Many of the enquires we’re getting are for one night stopovers from people fishing on the river. By the time we add up the gas, electricity and cleaning costs it isn’t worthwhile, so although I don’t want to pass up on business, we can’t take them. If they were fishing here it would be a different matter.
	I’m still struggling to understand how the Local Plan affects us directly. I gather the plan has been adopted, but no one seems able to tell me where stand with it. I was under the impression that the site was designated “a special area of conservation” but so far no one at the planning department will confirm that or tell me what it means to us. How are we expected to plan for the future development of the business if we don’t know what they’ll allow us to do? Apparently, the site is also “designated by Cumbria Wildlife Trust”. As what? No information from their website, and no phone call returned. It’s becoming increasingly clear that they want to dictate what we do but aren’t prepared to help us do it.
	I still haven’t had a decision on the house application yet, either so there’s no way we can be in a house by winter. The legal agreement they want us to sign hasn’t been drawn up yet apparently. The kids are very depressed at the moment, they have rather a short term view of life and the prospect of being in a caravan ‘forever’ is getting them down.
	PJ called round with a small group from the Market Towns Initiative  Group. Their proposals are being put forward to a meeting on the 22nd May at the community centre and she asked that I go along to represent the tourism side of the project. I think the idea is to let people know what is available and can be achieved on local level in an effort to get the whole community involved. It will be interesting to judge the reactions of the people of Longtown. Many of them only know us from what they read during the ‘smear campaign’ when we first arrived, so it might be an opportunity to set the record straight. There are of course, people who always think the worst, and people who never believe it in the first place. The court case is due to take place in June so hopefully that will finally put the matter to rest. The Market Towns Initiative could be useful for us in a number of ways. They plan youth projects etc as well as promotional events, and we briefly discussed coaching sessions for young anglers and so on. Whilst they don’t bring money in directly, they may encourage future visits.
	I’ve sent for some information on timber just to give us some idea of what we should expect to pay. The site did have planning permission for four of these a few years ago, but it lapsed before they got round to doing them. Holidaymakers are much more discerning in what they want from accommodation these days, and this may be the way we have to go. It has been suggested that our prices are putting off the higher end of the market, i.e. people don’t expect much from what we charge. Without having the other facilities in place, its difficult to judge how much people will be prepared to pay. What price do you put on seeing a woodpecker sitting on your window and deer in your back garden? I’m ever conscious of getting deeper into debt and disaster striking to the point where its probably holding us back. Three years ago, I would have looked objectively at a plan and had to confidence to take it forward. This week I would probably do the same, but next week, who knows? It doesn’t take much to shake me these days.
	Still, onwards and upwards. If the nice weather continues, the angler renew their season tickets and the tourers don’t use to much electricity at once we’ll survive another week.

Week Number: 12
Have had a pretty disastrous week, all down to my own stupidity basically. I rant on about people taken in by con men and almost fall for it myself. Workmen have been digging up the road just outside the gate for the last week, and one of them asked if I’d like them to do the entrance while they were there. It’s almost time for the BH + BPH inspection and the only negative comment last year was about the entrance so I figured it couldn’t do any harm to improve it a little. It turned out the chap who offered had nothing to do with the ‘official’ workmen and he came to me with a bill for £1, 800. He turned a bit nasty when I told him what to do with it and as I was here on my own I got a bit nervous. Anger at being ripped off took over though, so I deliberately wrote the cheque out to his company name, knowing full well he would change it, so the bank would refuse it. I had to work in the shop on Wednesday and the bank phoned me there to query it. They refused payment so when I got home there was a message from the ‘workman’. He called in again on Friday but there were more people around. I lied and said I had spoken to trading standards, gave him the details for my solicitor and said I’d see him court, at which point he said he’d take £300. Bit of a difference! I can’t believe how stupid I was. I haven’t told S bout it, no sense in causing an argument when its sorted now. Still, it struck me that even after I’d talked to this man about how difficult last year had been, he was still quite prepared to rip me off. What if I’d been a pensioner? It crossed my mind to phone the police, but I reckon they’d have put it down to me being stupid enough to agree in the first place. The problem with money being tight is that you try to cut corners and it can backfire. I hope I’ve learnt the lesson this time. I can’t sleep ‘cos I’m so annoyed with myself for falling into it.
	I worked in the shop Wednesday and Thursday and realised how short staffed we are there. It’s such a time consuming service. The shop is still subsidising O so until we can boost trade here, we can’t afford another salary.
	DT from Business Link called on Saturday to check the spending of the grant money, i.e. that we’d got the brochures printed, advertising booked etc. I had a laugh when he asked how efficient administration had been. I’m still waiting for the finial £400 to be paid. In truth, I’ve given up on it because I’ve written three times explaining the breakdown of my figures and sent invoices for more than the value of the claim (maybe that’s what confused them!) but each time they say they can’t work it out. David has promised to look into it. He also advised that we may be able to get help with planning consultancy. Having trawled through the outline proposal for Cumbria Rural Action Zone and a structure plan strategy file, I’m still none the wiser as to what they actually want for this area. Given how obstructive they’ve been to our house application, I think we need professional help. I don’t want to do anything to hold up the house planning, but if we can get advice on what the council are likely to pass at least we can start to plan where the site can go from here.
	I’m still getting plenty of enquires, some from people interested in leaving their caravans here all year round. The council won’t let us do this at the moment, they limit the number, so it’s something else to look at in the grand scheme of things.
	I took the dog to have her coat clipped this week, so she looks like a pup again. Pity reality isn’t that easy. She hasn’t been too bad this week though, more comfortable with a short coat. She needs to go back for a check in two weeks at the vet, so hopefully all will be well.
	The couple we had in the statics left early as there is still work going on outside the roan and they left a generator running all night to operate traffic lights. ‘Necessary Maintenance’ is all I can get from the workmen. Our visitors were very nice about it and said they’d be back later in the year, but it isn’t a very good first impression is it?

Week Number: 13
I’m writing rather belatedly as we decided at the last minute to visit a trade show in Germany. It’s primarily for the pet industry but has a major aquatics section profiling what’s new and what should, in theory, be the next ‘big thing’ in our business.
	Against my better judgement, I agreed to take the boys with us. [daughter] had GCSEs in a couple of weeks, so decided no to come. We drove to Nurnberg and stayed at a small guesthouse just outside. I have to say I really enjoyed it. Driving all the way gave us the opportunity to stop at campsites, services etc and compare what we do with theirs. I don’t think they were a patch on ours as regards location, but then I may be slightly biased. They are, however, in a different league when it comes to service and quality. Our motorway services are abysmal in comparison. I did get lots of ideas for the site as well as the shop though. Whether I can put them into practise or not, it was good to see things from a visitor point of view and note the little touches that make a difference.
	The boys had a great time too, it brought us back together a little. I think we tend to forget how to spend time as a family, we’re all so busy doing our separate things at present.
	Before we left I had a letter from the councils legal department asking us to confirm that we will pay all legal costs. The powers that be again! We’re supposed to pay because they want to restrict what we can do our own property! I understand the need for planning restrictions. I fully accept the need for some rules and regulations. I just don’t understand why we need so many apparently pointless ones. And shy should I have to pay for them!
	Anyway, our solicitor advises that this is normal practise, so it looks like we’ll have to go along with it. He’s trying to find out how much it will cost, so by the time the bill is added on we’ll be out of pocket and still don’t know if they’ll allow us to build the house anyway.   

Week Number: 14
Have been buried under a mountain of paperwork this week after my little jaunt to Germany. Wouldn’t believe the amount of junk mail that is delivered in one week. According to these, I’m already so rich I needn’t be working about how to pay the next electricity bill. I’m in so many prize draws, I can retire!
	Arthur covered two extra days while we were in Germany, so he was due to go home on Wednesday and have five days off. I didn’t find out until Thursday that he’s been coughing up blood for two days, so I phoned his wife. It turns out he hadn’t said anything because he didn’t want to worry is or give us more problems! I can’t believe he didn’t tell me. He was kept in hospital overnight and allowed home the next day after tests. They’ve said his blood pressure is way too high and he needs special tests on Monday. His wife says he’s fretting now over the work that needs to be done here and he’ll manage on sick pay, so I’ve told her we’re managing the work and that he’ll be on full pay until the Doc says he can come back. He’s done so much more that he’s paid for here, above and beyond and they say. If I’m honest, I feel really guilty, wondering if the extra days were too much, if the work is too heavy etc. Both him and Linda go out in all weathers. Linda is sensible and accepts her limitations but Arthur won’t give in. His wife assures me he’s feeling much better, the coughing has stopped and he’s taking tablets for the blood pressure. We have to wait ‘till Monday for the other tests. I think everyone’s relieved after thinking the worst.
	The weather has warmed up again, so the fish are biting and the campers are happy. I missed the meeting in Longtown on the lessons to be learned theme, which was a pity. We had some youngsters fishing the boys pool and they needed to be supervised in case of accidents. Their parents didn’t turn up until after nine, so it was too late to go. I’m hoping the Cumberland News will give details as the bits I’ve caught on local news have been patchy. The people from the auction mart insist it could all happen again easily though, which is worrying. I had also thought the auction mart were slow to react in the first instance, which turns out not to be the case, so it would be nice to know the real facts behind it all. Will we learn the truth behind the rumours of timber companies being approached beforehand? Will better farming practises result? Was it a ploy to reduce the numbers in farming? I’ve said before that there isn’t much point in looking backwards, but I’m beginning to understand why people do. They want the truth out in the open and that’s no bad thing. Anything that lessens the chance of this type of catastrophe occurring again.
	The planning department in their wisdom have decided that the permission we have for static caravans no longer applies for lodges. The statics were originally put in place to hold permission for chalets until the previous owners could afford to build them. So if we want lodges we have to re-apply! I’m beginning to think there’s some kind of conspiracy going on. I’ve just read that an application has been put in for the houses on the M.O.D estate to have gas tanks installed. We can’t site tents on our side of the fence because of their so called ‘blast line’, but houses within their compound can have huge gas tanks! I think I’ve finally lost the plot.

Week Number: 15
	It has rained most of this week, so we have more ponds than usual, particularly in the car park. I hope it dries up before next weekend. I’ve had yet another reminder of how cruel nature can be. I found a day old blue tit lying on the patio just outside the office on Monday morning. These things happen, I thought, and disposed of it. A few hours later there was another, then anther until by evening six babies and the mother had been killed. I caught sight of a sparrow going into the same hole in the roof, so it may have been that. We also had a gannet blown off course and too weak to fly on Friday, so I took it to Knoxwood. It’s the first time I’ve been there, although we have had help with swans frozen on the lake a few times. The assortment of rescues  is amazing and I admire them so much for keeping going throughout last year.
	Our court case in Newcastle is drawing closer so we had Durham police on the phone to say they don’t know the order of witnesses as yet, so I should allow the full three weeks. We can’t afford to be away from business for that length of time, so I’m hoping we’ll be called in the first few days. Assuming it actually goes ahead this time. PCs Woods theory is that they’ve deliberately delayed it until now because there’s a greater chance of witnesses being on holiday etc so it will be postponed again. I just wish it was over and done with. I’ve never even been in a courtroom before, much less a witness. It isn’t fair that one man’s petty grievance can cause so much disruption in our lives.
	There was a presentation for Markets Towns Initiative scheme on Wednesday, outlining what people would like to see in the area and how it could be achieved. There was a great deal of useful information on show, including a summary of Carlisle’s local plan which is helpful for our development plans. I took some brochures and produced a couple of posters to show local people what’s available on site. I think many of the locals have been reluctant to visit because of what’s gone on in the past, so hopefully they’ll come to realise what’s on their doorstep.
	Having seen the plan at the meeting, I went to the Civic Centre to buy one (£32!!) I think it might help us focus on  what we want to do here – no point applying for things they definitely won’t allow. As I thought, we’re a designated a ‘wildlife’ site by Cumbria Wildlife Trust – still no explanation as to what that means exactly. I also discovered that planning permission was granted for storing rolling stock at DM Longtown, which borders our site. So apparently they can have trains but we can’t have caravans. I can’t help feeling that we’re up against a brick wall here. We need to recover from last year by pushing forward but we have to fight for every inch. I keep hearing about how everyone is doing everything in their power to help businesses affected last year. Leaving farmers aside, I feel our type of business, in this area particularly, would be next inline for advice, help or at least some indication that the powers that be are aware of the problem. It would be so much easier to sit back and say “sod it, I’ve had enough”! Let’s see how much wildlife is left when the place is overgrown and teeming with rats as it was when we came. The local plan states that more quality accommodation is needed in the area, so lodges on site would seem ideal – not so! They’ll only allow us to have them if we cram four in right by the existing building, so we end up with a ‘mini housing estate’. Beggars belief!
	At least the Lakes are fishing well at present. We’ve had the biggest fish so far caught this week and 25Lbs, so I’m hoping to make some of the angling papers as well as the Cumberland News. It came from the Lake that only season ticket holders are allowed to fish, so we might tempt a few more.
	The weather forecast for the Bank Holiday weekend isn’t too bad. There’s lots going on in Longtown as well as our own fishing competition etc, so I’m hoping for a busy weekend. Fingers crossed for the electrics. Arthur is still off, so I’m in trouble if anything goes wrong with the hook ups. The majority of our regulars are really good about it, but it’s the impression that first time visitors take away that counts just as much. Better cross my toes too.

Week Number: 16
	Arthur is still off this week and is waiting for the results of scans and blood tests etc. He says he’s feeling better in himself which is good news, but he’s starting to worry about the work that won’t be done while he’s not here. I’ve tried to tell that he wouldn’t be able to do much of it at the moment anyway as we are quite busy with visitors and anglers so we can’t get round with grass cutters etc. He reckons he’ll be fit for work next week, so I hope he’s not just saying that because he feels guilty. It’ll be worse in the long run if he comes back to soon.
	Longtown’s Jubilee Celebrations were a huge success. It was a glorious success. A glorious day and so good to see people relaxed and happy. Much hard work into it so I’m glad it went well. I don’t know how many people were in Longtown really, so I have nothing to compare pre foot and mouth, but there was a definite community spirit. 
	Unfortunately, the weather changed on Sunday. Our disabled angling group had organised a junior and senior angling competition as well as a barbecue in the evening. I felt so sorry for the kids sitting there in the pouring rain, detriment to not give in – a lesson to be learned I think, since the adults called theirs off.
	Before we took over O, there was a split in the disabled group over something quite petty from what I can gather. We undertook to promote D Lake as a venue for disabled anglers and have been approached by some asking if they could use it. J C, who owns D Estate, is just getting over his nervousness about the spread of foot and mouth (we couldn’t use the lake or river fishing last year) and is keen to establish it again. I tried to point out to our group that they don’t have exclusive use and that in the interests of increasing their membership they should be encouraging others, but because it came from the ‘breakaway group’, they’ve taken the hump. I get the feeling I can’t win. Petty politics breach all levels – so I’ll go ahead anyway. If I can push this we would be in with a chance of hosting the Jack Charlton competition there, which is great publicity.
	Only one electricity trip out this weekend thankfully. I suspect the caravans users tried to use too many appliances at once as it only affected one van, but its still not acceptable anyway. People want to watch the television etc when it’s miserable weather. I’m nowhere near getting the money for the upgrades and the whole system is due for checking and inspection as the end of July. Even if Dave Thornley comes through with a contribution from somewhere I’m going to need bank borrowing. We seem to be a bit of standstill at the moment as regards to planning and I’m struggling to work up enthusiasm for anything because I know it involves money we don’t have. I’m reading in the local paper that everyone and their dog has applied for permission for extending their business, diversifying into tourism etc, and can’t help thinking I’ve got it wrong somewhere. 

Week Number: 17
	A pretty disastrous week from start to finish really. I telephoned our solicitor to check that he’d sent a copy of the land register to the council’s solicitor and on a separate note, he said he was waiting for the local police to call as he’d been asked to make a supplementary statement for our case against Robert Walker. Alarm bells started ringing as we’ve been a week from trial before and it’s been cancelled. Sure enough, I got a phone call to say it’s been postponed for one week, and off the record, they don’t think it’ll be the following week either. I’m totally dumbfounded. One man has a petty grudge against us and our lives are supposed to be on hold for two years. The defences haven’t had time to make their case! We’d arranged cover for the shop and the site, my mum was coming down to look after the kids, we’d just about psyched ourselves up, and he’s done it again! He’s using every trick in the book. Apparently, they had allocated time slots for witnesses and had allowed one hour in my case. I’ve never been inside courtroom and he wanted me questioned for an hour! I can’t believe people are allowed to do this. I ended up in tears after speaking to the D.C from Carlisle who have handled the case so far. They’re so sympathetic and sound as angry as I am, but there’s nothing they can do. I’ve been so worried and tense about going to court anyway, thinking at least it would be over in about twenty minutes. Now to learn that he’s going to try to drag it out even more, I can’t believe it!
	The week just got better and better. My fourteen year old son came on Saturday, and couldn’t put a sentence together. I though he was drunk, which was bad enough, but it turned out he’d been smoking cannabis. I’m totally naïve about drugs, which is ridiculous in this day and age, but it frightened the life out of me. I couldn’t get any sense out of him on Saturday, so I left him to sleep it off. After the initial shouting match on Sunday (wrong way to handle it, but I’m not having a good week) I finally calmed down enough to ask why he did it. His response is that he hates living here, is ashamed of living in a caravan, wishes he was back in Penrith and generally thinks life sucks. I’m at a loss for what to do now. I’ve tried to explain the situation but he can’t see why we don’t sell up and move back to Penrith instead of  putting everything we have into a loss making business. I knew the house thing was a huge issue for him – it is for all of us, made worse by the poor weather we’ve had recently. We’re on top of each other all the time. I’m going to have to try to push things along which means more bank borrowing . I’m thinking maybe I also made a mistake by allowing him to stay at school in Penrith and nor forcing him into making friends here, so I’ve taken the decision to move him to school in Longtown. I took the cowards way out and said Ullswater school had heard about his episode on Saturday and didn’t want him back, so although he’s not particularly happy, he seems to have accepted the decision. Maybe this has cleared the air a little and given him the chance of a new start in time to make a difference. If he has stayed with the same crowd in Penrith, his exams will suffer next year, so maybe this could be for the best.
	I’m glad this week’s over, I don’t think I could taking anything else right now.

Week Number: 18
	I’ve moved [son] to Longtown school this week and its better than I thought, on the face of it.  He went to football practice on Friday evening and seemed to enjoy it.  I didn’t say anything to the school about last week as I think it might have influenced how they treat him initially and that in turn will influence how he settles in.  he’s come home talking about what he’s been doing and the lads he’s met so although it’s not going to be plain sailing I think he’s off to a reasonable start.
I telephoned the city council legal department and apparently they’re very busy at present but they hope to start on our agreement in the next week or so!  I feel as if I’ve lost all energy to rant and rave and push things into action. I’m allowing all these things to dictate the way my life is going and I don’t have the energy to argue. 
	S is suffering really badly with hay fever or something at the moment so it isn’t fair to moan at him for everything else that isn’t going to plan.  I did have an interesting conversation with another local businessman this week, who tells me there are grants for everything available but you have to be really obnoxious and determined to get them. He’s put planning applications in for almost every aspect of his business and has had grants to help with his business plan as well as towards the cost of improvements and expansion.  I’ve come to the conclusion that that we’ve been sitting back too much.  We’re letting everyone else take the lead instead of just going for it.  I think we both feel so knocked down at the moment.  We’re normally able to balance each other out quite well but not this week.  There’s just this overwhelming feeling of ‘what’s the point’.
The ‘Lakes’ at least are still fishing well so the anglers are quite happy.  Our work to colour the water and clear the weed seems to have paid off.  One of the statics is rented this week too, by an old chap who used to visit the area regularly so he’s been telling me how much has changed.  We’ve had a couple of tents on over the week end too, despite the ground being really soggy.  They seemed quite surprised at the facilities we have, so I’m not sure if it’s because they’re used to camping in a field or that we are actually getting it right somewhere.  The amount of rain we’ve had has shown the car park in its true colours, we had ducks swimming under our vehicles the other day.  Highly amusing to us, but not a very good impression for visitors.
I hope I can shake this mood off in the next few days, I need something positive to go at to get back on track.  Sod Walker and the British justice system!
	 

Week Number: 19
Not much going on again this week really. Ash went on a school trip Monday to Friday and seemed to really enjoy himself so he’s quite happy for a while. [son] seem to be settling in to school reasonably well. I’ll phone his head of year next week to see what she thinks. He’s showing an interest in fishing again which is a good sign.

Still no news on the house application which is a bit disappointing. Saying that, we’ve no money at present anyway, so we probably can’t afford to start just yet. I think just the idea that we could go ahead when we’re ready would make a difference though. I know it would put the kinds in a more positive frame of mind. [daughter] finished her exams this week and I think she’s quietly confident. She’s been telling me what her friends are getting if they do well and although she would never ask, I think she’s hoping for similar treatment. I feel bad that we’re not able to do it – she’s worked so hard.

We had some teenagers from Longtown playing around with the digger on the far bank of the Lake on Thursday. They’re nice enough kids – just bored I suppose. If anything comes out of the market towns initiative, I hope it’s some kind of activity they want to do.

I took [daughter] to Carlisle to find a dress for her prom but no luck. She’s not really a ‘dress’ type girl and I was secretly relieved when I saw the prices. She finally settled on a plain black one rather than anything fancy so it wasn’t too bad in the end.

My mum’s been in hospital again this week for another operation on her throat. She was really down when I phoned her on Friday so I went up to visit her Saturday evening. There’s been such a change in her in this last year, I have to remind myself not to register shock when I see her.

All in all another week of everything getting me down really. It’s still raining so maybe that’s got something to do with it. Everything seems much better when the sun shines.

Am hoping for greater things next week – positive mental attitude.

Week Number: 20 (24-06-02)
Things appear to have settled this week with regard to [son] – he’s showing signs of thinking things through before he does them. That’s not to say he’s very much happier with the situation we find ourselves in – no news on the house application – but he is at least giving school a chance.

Bookings are slow at present and although I think the weather is playing a large part, I’m not sure we’re getting it right on the static’s. They are old vans and although they are comfortable and clean we may be putting people off with the price. It’s a no win situation really – people expect to pay more so they assume the van must be awful.

The amount of rain we’ve had is making the car park a disaster area although people who have turned up are telling me everywhere else is the same. We’ve had an Australian couple and two German Bikers this week , so that’s a positive sign.

The poor weather has a big impact on the shop too, which we really can’t afford. O is still heavily subsided by our income from there and although we knew this would be the case, we obviously hadn’t foreseen last years disaster so we had planned for the dependency to be lessoning by now. In truth, I wonder at times  what made us go into business at all. Life would be so much simpler if we could leave the decision making someone else, finish at 5 p.m. and close the door on the problems. I think the kids long for a ‘normal’ life. [daughter] has actually said her teachers thought she was from a single parent family as they’d never seen her Dad at school events. She’s very bright, well balance young woman and it pains me to think she doesn’t have a close relationship with her Dad because we were too busy. The boys have common interests so they can share that but I think she’s misses out.

But when I think about the big picture it seems so unthinkable that I can’t motivate myself to get started. All the little things need to be put into place but there are so many of them.

C mentioned the counselling service when she was here and I truly wish I could do it, but I’m not able to talk. Sounds ridiculous when I’m writing this for who knows to see, but sitting face to face with something is a completely different matter. I feel like everyone else doing the diaries is probably getting on with things, positive attitude and doing what it takes to get back on track. There are people who will have been much harder hit last year than we were and yet I here I am still making excuses and getting nowhere. I’d like to go to the social evening but right now am wondering whether it will do more harm than good. It would be nice to meet the others but if I come away feeling more inadequate than I do now, it may not be a good idea. Who knows maybe it’s just the miserable weather. How long have I been saying that? Time for a walk, I think – rain or nor rain.

Week Number: 21 (1-7-02)
 Carlisle City Council have played a blunder yet again. Apparently we’re now fully recovered from the disaster last season and are able to pay full business rates again. In reality I know it comes from the valuation office but surely someone is able to enlighten them. Our bill has gone right back to pre foot and mouth levels (already too high for the income of the sigh). When I telephoned the valuation office they sympathised but said the government had decided the relief cut off date should be the 3id March. When I’m reading in the paper about how much money the council allegedly made from the clean up operation I’m wondering why they can’t do something to help. We took £737 in June and we’re supposed to pay £238 of that for rates. Should I tell Arthur and Linda now or save it as a surprise? Once again I’m left wondering why we bother.

[daughter] left for her school trip on Saturday, so apart from the usual worries about the travel etc, she seemed quite happy. She’s said she’ll help out over the summer doing the tea and coffee etc, so I know she suspects we’re having problems. Actually it might be good to have a brainstorming session with the kids to see what all of us really want to get out of life at present.

End of July is our financial year end so I suppose I should start on getting the accounts sorted. There won’t be much to do on O, but the shop stock causes a nightmare every year. Life just keeps getting better and better!

At least the rain isn’t harming the wildlife. I caught site of six baby moorhens on Sunday morning – so cute! It seems such a long time since I had a proper walk around and really looked at anything. Maybe in the back of my mind I’m trying to detach myself from it in case the worst happens. 

Week Number: 22 (8-7-02)
We’ve had a blazing row to start the week, an event becoming more and more frequent. I’m finding it very difficult to focus on where we want to go with the site and S is becoming very impatient and frustrated. I think we’ve just about done everything that doesn’t cost money are left with making the decision on whether to put everything on the line or not.  The simple fact is that I’m scared. Not about the pressure that would then put on us as a family.  We’re already putting our kids through so much.

I’ve made a start on the shop accounts but progress is slow. We ended up in another row over stock levels of all things – it’s just been one of those weeks. I’m missing [daughter]  - she usually manages to lighten the mood, We had an inquiry about letting the top field for sheep grazing from the manager to the poultry farm behind us.  Whilst the little money it would bring in would be useful, we can’t take the chance.  The way the NFU talk, foot and mouth could break out at any time with the same consequences as last year.  I know we can’t run things based on what might happen, but that’s a risk I’m not prepared to take.

The inspector from the council was here on Thursday checking the fire precautions and asking for the electrical safety certificate.  We have until the end of the month to produce it and since the chap who has done it in previous years is no longer taking this kind of business, I have to find someone else. The guy who was doing it had also done some of the original work and knew the history of the place which made things a bit easier.  Bringing in someone completely new is a whole different ball game so maybe my worries are for nothing and we’ll be closed at the end of July anyway.

I’m still in two minds over the get together for the group (study respondents had been invited t a social gathering].  I’ve been thinking this week that maybe I shouldn’t even be doing the diaries.  Most of the things I mention aren’t related to foot and mouth at all and although some of them are a consequence of it, the problems probably go deeper.  It does me good to write it down, but it probably isn’t relevant to the study. I’m sure everyone else is just getting on with it and since I don’t seem able to at present, there must be other factors playing a part.

[daughter] came home Sunday and seems to have had a great time. The prisoner of war camps had a deep effect on her, as did life in Poland.  She’s very good at putting things into perspective and realising just what she has in life compared to others.  Maybe I should go on the same kind of trip.

WEEK  1        
Monday 28/1/02-Average day, very windy and wet. Another shop turning into 
antiques. Learn Cumbria CC (County Council) is being given £25m to turn county “broad band”. If true good for future. Talked to holiday operator who lost great deal of money – no compensation.
Tuesday-FMD enquiry report – says nothing really, most people want a public 
enquiry. Meeting with J. Rambled on too long as usual.
Wednesday-Walking festival meeting. Had to cancel because of closed paths but 
now decide to have a one day affair in June
Friday-Health Centre for Op, postpone but read terrible article in AGA(?) magazine 
about “Long QT”
Saturday-Work again. Find it very tiring for no reason other than stress. Good night 
out at Rattan and Rush, live music in Kirkby Stephen with a meal – Excellent (end of 
ad)

Week 2 No entries

WEEK  3
Friday    15th Feb Local papers carry articles about the forthcoming 
agricultural shows- no sheep/cattle/pigs/goats allowed


WEEK 4        
Monday 18th Feb-Half term holiday lots of visitors many still surprised by signs of 
ongoing FMD
Tuesday-Today is the first anniversary of FMD! 
DEFRA have warned farms locally that they are on high alert for a repeat 
performance during lambing.
Wednesday-Another local case of FMD antibodies in a local sheep (culled) what a 
bring down
Friday-Wake up and open curtains to find “boiler suits” being donned for 
neighbouring farm is this the start of it again!
Saturday-Dine with local farmer who has not seen the “vets” but thinks it could be 
increased testing with the few cases discovered of antibodies locally
Suspected outbreak at Thirsk (Hawnby)

The triangle of Farmers/DEFRA/Visitors still leads to confrontation. Have had visitors 
complaining that paths are closed due to re-stocking. But when check with access 
line am told that this is not legal. Farmers say it’s on DEFRA advice somebody needs 
really to get a grip on this.
The much-publicised FMD outbreak (suspected) in the Thirsk area leads to a 
depressed holiday market with hoteliers talking of Easter cancellations. Visitors are 
contemplating another bad year and photography seems to be coming out of a slump 
in that quotes are increasing though no jobs are coming from them at the moment. 
With some clients being re-equipped by business link grants I will need to re-equip to 
stay in the game but the investment needs careful planning.

Week 5
Hasn't rained for over two weeks in serious way, this lovely spring weather certainly 
helps! I can ignore the macho management style at work now but why do ""they"" feel 
it necessary to bully. I wonder where all humility went, the world seems to be full of 
whiz-kids who only know the textbook but have no sense! (hey I'm getting old!)

Week 6
A little more ""action"" on the photographic front with a few quotes in the pipeline (four 
for different designers for the same work!) nobody seems to have time any more to 
talk jobs through, just want a figure plucked out of thin air.
Visitors to the TIC still well down and some still quite ""damaged"" from FMD, while 
others from city areas think it was all over in a couple of weeks!
As usual lots of future plans to spend FMD money from various agencies who in the 
main are just securing their own futures!

Week 7
Not many changes this week but looking forward to a few days in Suffolk next week.
Seem to be at complete odds with ""management"" at work who introduce paper 
pushing as an Olympic sport. Too much time is now spend on ""non - core"" work.
This spring/summer weather has made a welcome appearance and has enabled 
start on one or two photo jobs delayed by the rain.
Many strange animals can now be seen with re-stocking - herdwicks in the Eden 
Valley, alpacas, horses.

Week 8
A few days away with very good friends in Suffolk reminds me what a poor, 
disadvantaged area Cumbria is. Very let down by its councils, and central 
government.
I am surprised by the amount of visible ""foot and mouth"" warnings in Suffolk/Norfolk 
most seem to have quietly vanished from Cumbria but are still larger than life in 
Suffolk, though no disease.
I had been surprised to by the sharp increase in property prices in Cumbria though 
they have a long way to go to reach even the prices in Suffolk (am shown a small 
two-up two-down terraced cottage in Southwold with a good position but no sea view 
and no extending possibility £500,000!) . With the new prices in Cumbria wages must 
raise fairly drastically to compete with FMD ""compensation"" and we only have as 
single reply for part-time TIC assistant as ours/or wages are bad (before we have 
had 80+). MAFF showed the light paying around £9 per hour so look out for a ""sea-
change"".

Week 9
Back to work, not enough hours to accomplish all its needed - always seem to be at 
loggerheads with TIC management and fighting the technology, but a little bird says 
new person to head IT department so perhaps some improvements may happen.
Tourism is having a shake-up in most councils in Cumbria with reorganisations and 
redundancies whilst new marketing groups etc take over traditional roles with new 
grants (FMD, Europe, north-west etc). many good people out on their ears while the 
new turks take over!
Photography is still down, a few regular clients are cutting back and the jobs created 
by Business Link seemed to have come to an end. (and equipping companies with IT 
grants means many are doing the work ( poorly!) in house.)

Week 10
Another summer has begun many more people about in TIC (Tourist Information Centre)  but actually they are increasingly busy, numbers on the counter (tally) day by day on not showing much improvement on last year's (3000 plus down on average).
Appleby Fair brought what was to be a record number of gypsies but in the end it 
petered out with bad weather poor trading and a lot of illness among travellers - so 
I'm told.
One set of camera equipment finally gave up the ghost and needs replacing, the 
trouble is do I replace with old traditional equipment for £3,000 which has perhaps no 
future or go digital in a bigger way (£12,000) with a possible life span of two/three 
years. We have to wait a few months for newly announced models before making the 
wrong decision!
£3 ticket on Settle  - Carlisle line for locals has meant several trips to Leeds and 
environs and am amazed at how many shops etc have closed from last year's visit 
and wonder if this is due to FMD with lack of us country folk visiting and spending.
Photograph two hotels who changed hands at the beginning of last year and had no 
income but seem amazingly buoyant about future prospects even though hardly any 
improvement in trade so far.

Week 11 No entries

Week 12
To Sedbergh to do a hotel with new chef and food shots, once photographed the staff 
(part-time girls) are given a taste and talk about the dishes, which are super looking 
but being a local they don't like messed about foreign food - still living in the dark 
ages!
Still a few farmers having go at the TIC for ""sending"" people on to their land. But 
times should have changed for them but things do seem to be slipping back to the 
""old ways"" not sure they can be sustained in future. (though a lot of local farmers 
have been more cautious about re-entering the trade).
Sheep are making a comeback as icons lately! Have been asked for a few photos 
with them, and the sand sculpture weekend of a flock of sheep in Kirkby Stephen is 
mooted for the summer!
Received a wadge of paperwork from the Countryside Agency to ""express an 
interest"" in (only) tendering for some photo-shoots, the sheer bureaucracy is 
ridiculous (Enclose a CV just to be able to be invited to quote!) am seething as the 
amount of work for an ""expression"" is around five evenings (at least 30 hours) the 
world is nuts.

Week 13
Hooray for Rattan and Rush (tea room of Plus) in Kirkby Stephen, who once a 
month (+ -) put on a live music supper with some great musicians/performers. It is a 
gem and the couple, Paul and Penny, who organise it do a fantastic job. But though 
successful worry about lack of ""locals"". Anyway it is always very good and worth 
looking forward to.
My father who moved into sheltered accommodation up here 18 months ago from the 
south still has not settled, and it's a bit unnerving seeing him every day from three or 
four times a year and watched him get old and not realise it - he loves the sea and 
have stuck him in the middle of the country (and he's a born townie!).
Still worried by lack of visitors to the area but see Majorca is complaining about a 
40% drop (but they blame  the €1 bed tax (60 p!)). Surprisingly quite a few Americans 
about who seemed concerned for us regarding the hoof and mouth, TB in cattle, the 
BSE in chickens (do we have to put beef protein in chicken?)
Welsh farmer and wife very distraught by F and M when in TIC as ""TB"" restrictions in 
their area are bringing it all back I suppose.

Next 4 diaries collected Thursday 24th October 2002
Week 32 Sept
Late summer is a bonus but visitors are down in numbers. Foot and mouth scares 
again don't help and farmers not following the new (possibly over-the-top) regulations 
are making some people annoyed.
The horse sales did well ""horsey culture"" being the new growth area.
Pupil on work experience seems very confident and able and willing to tackle most 
jobs including talking to the public (a new development!) and certainly brings some 
cheer into a very quiet TIC.

Week 33 Sept
Oh dear, New ""IT"" opportunities for E - business seem very Big Brother with 
databases gathering information and also interacting locally. (do you want your 
mobile phone to tell you what to do, where to stay, where to eat  etc)
The main trouble seems to be the people in charge of the new technologies are a) 
humourless corporate faces and b) can't work it probably anyway (probably the 
saving grace!)
Colleague at work is leaving to do a post grad at Lancaster and comes in after the 
first few days fairly shell-shocked at the commercial/foreign element that university is 
now.

Week 34(Oct 02)
Start of a holiday.
And time for one to!
The ""Eden Project"" is very interesting and looks to have kick-started a large slice of 
the local economy. Though Devon seems to be moving up Cornwall, away from the 
coast, is looking very poor and down-at-heel. A lot of Cornish home rule about, but 
do they resent visitors to the Eden Project which even in late October is very busy. 
The gift shop quite full of local made items. Many galleries and craft shops 
throughout Devon and Cornwall, how do they all make a living? Farming looks quite 
small-scale the though very ""niched"" marketing of rare breeds etc

Week 35  (Oct 02)
Second week of the holiday and his most refreshing. The Isles of Scilly are most 
relaxing (though underneath the tranquillity there appears to be the dead hand of 
Charles/Duchy of Cornwall. Is this the way forward? More research I think).
Returning to ""the mainland"" traffic is most noticeable - our lives might be greatly 
improved without it. Is ""local"" the answer?
This raises a lot of questions 
(respondent attaches newspaper story headlined pedigree ram is sold for a record 
£101,000 dated 22nd October 2002. Story about an 18 month old Swaledale ram 
said to be Britain's first six-figure ram, sold at auction at Kirkby Stephen)

Week 36 Nov 1
Busy week at TIC. How come there is never enough time to start/finish things, 10 
hours isn’t enough!
The walking festival seems to be taking shape for next year, I’m always amazed at 
the energy of some people, how do they fit it all in? Several photographic clients of 
clients have not paid their bills (though luckily I have been paid), seems to be hotels 
mainly.
Another postcard producer has just upped his loss from £7000 to nearer £20,000 for 
last year (2001) – it’s come as a surprise and too late to claim anything.!
My father seems to be ageing faster now- it’s difficult living close and watching it 
happen. (selfish me!)

Week 37 (Nov 7 02)
What an average week
Time for the St John’s Wort methinks!
Surveyors at the TIC were supposed to be doing a structural survey but it looks like a 
valuation to me. God help us if it was structural, 4 of them acting like clowns! Didn’t 
even look in the cellar.
Finding other people increasingly irritating. Partly down to short TIC hours but too 
much work. And a newish member of staff who lacks in-depth training, roll on Easter.

Week 38 (Nov 14/02)
Can’t really get it together, lots of things to look forward to yet not much pleasure in 
them.
Just go through the motions though a couple of “music evenings” were enjoyable.
Have to sell cars as new one on the way, seems a daunting task and a waste of time 
for little return.

Week 39 (Nov 21 /02
New car is finally on the horizon but can’t shift me old’uns. Have a few time-wasters 
around but eventually put Mercedes G Wagon in a 4X4 sale in Carlisle (if you haven’t 
been to an auction try not to if selling!) ends up not selling as below the reserve bid 
then sells next day at car auction. You always think your car is worth more but very 
cheap prices at auction good for selling no doubt.
Saab gets swapped for a new bike! Anyway gets them out of the way.
It’s funny with new camera equipment and new car one would expect to be “happier” 
but don’t feel much – old age creeping on or depression?

Week 40 (Dec 1)
Have been awarded to 12 months contracts for the Countryside Agency for 
photography after an enormous amount of tendering. The bureaucracy in this country 
is going far too much overboard nowadays. Seem to meet quite a few people who 
are withdrawing from the world that is ""normal"" and ploughing their own furrow. The 
supposed widening of choice and empowering people seems to me to be backfiring 
and become a sort of bullying.
Another 3 staff questionnaires this week including the annual communication one 
(they never addressed the issues in last year's) What is the point? Oh and we are to 
have six-monthly assessments now (again what for - it's just bullying!)

Week 41 (Dec7)
My father (90) has been ill twice this week and gone downhill the very fast (though 
getting better) can't easily watch him age without projecting my future.
Christmas seems to have started with lots of jollys on one level and war, no 
pensions, work till your 70+, on another, it seems the society I thought we had is 
breaking up. (Can’t even get any Christmas stamps in the Post Office's 12 days 
before last posting date!) it's every man for himself now.

Week 42 (Dec 14)
My colleague at the TIC has had three deaths in four weeks on the road outside 
his home, can't help thinking I'd be even more depressed living there (one death a 
well-known local chap).
My father is surprised by number of Christmas cards he has had from down south 
where he used to live, he worries that he hasn't responded but he doesn't know 
names and addresses any more as he used to hand deliver.
He is a lot better this week though he's had very good health care, a local lady was 
taken by ambulance in the night to Kendal with pneumonia but they refused to admit 
her or deal with her so had to wait till morning in the A and E department till her 
husband could pick her up! Out-of-hours health service now has to go first to NHS 
Direct before they decide whether to contact Cue Doc. Another nail in society’s coffin!

Well initially it was more the business it affected.

Right.

Because I’m a partner in the business and it was the income really that you were concerned about because all the night we weren’t earning anything.  It just stopped completely.  And naively on the 1st of March we called staff back and laid them off and thought we would be working within a fortnight.  Um, but unfortunately we weren’t.

So how did events unfold?

Well I think everybody got into the same mood, farmers that we talked to and that.  I mean we became in a certain way, we became somebody to phone up and chat to because people felt lifeless and it was lovely that people did that.  We could share their problems and it was so horrific for the people who went down with Foot & Mouth at the beginning.  I can remember one man calling me, no I phoned him, because I started phoning people after they went down, and all our customers, I phoned them when I knew.  Because continually we were on the phone to the Ministry finding out who was the next one, who was the next one.  And um I used to phone them all up and sort of just have a bit of a chat.  And one man, a 40 year old man he just couldn’t fake, he was in tears, and he was always the person who came on and spoke to me, pulled me leg, chatted away, great character, and he couldn’t speak to me.  And I came off the phone and I was just in tears.  And I said, “I’m not gonna phone anybody up” I couldn’t after that.  And so I used to send them cards and people’d phone up and thank me or they’d send me something back and it was lovely.  Um, but it was everybody lived for the news bulletins.  You used to sit and even farmers, when you were talking to people, they used to flick from BBC1, ITV, Channel 4, and you just lived flicking channels, listening on teletext seeing what was updated.  And one didn’t correspond with the other and then phoning (21) every 5 minutes to find out who was the next one or getting on the internet.  Because everybody wanted to know, they wanted to know what was happening and it was the fact that there wasn’t the information, people didn’t know, they were all in the dark.  And they were all so frustrated because they didn’t know and events sort of escalated so quickly.  Um, and out of control.  And even though government and ministers and everybody um, assured everybody it was under control, it was never under control in the beginning.  And it was only when the army came in that people breathed a huge sigh of relief um, they definitely did.  Everybody, didn’t matter who they were if they were farmers or not, I can remember seeing animals laying in fields that you thought that it was cats sitting down and then you realised they were lying there dead.  I never, well I did actually see some sheep slaughtered, which was a pure accident because I happened to be walking past and I didn’t know they were slaughtering them.  Um, but that was horrible seeing that.  Er, I don’t think people should have been shielded from it I think people should have seen it, they should have really understood what it was all about.  The pyres, seeing the pyres built and some of them were in public places on public roads and seeing them burning.  And I remember going over a main road and counting them and I could see 14 pyres burning in one go and the smell yeah, was horrible.

I guess your life changed?

Yeah, it was, it was a whole, a whole different life which wasn’t so bad in a way.  I mean, that sounds daft really but in January we’ve been sort of saying things have got a bit mundane you know, never in a million years thinking what was gonna happen.  But yeah you were chugging along and you were making a living and you know.  But I mean I’ve got like 15 years before I retire and I kept thinking, well this is life until I retire, you know its just the business had been going along enough it had settled down, everything ticked over.  But I needed more than that.  And then all of a sudden Foot & Mouth and you think no, maybe it was better just ticking over.  Yeah, you life did change because I was used to getting up at half 6 in the morning and getting home at half 4 at night.  Um, from morning going into work, we weren’t going in till 9, 10 o’clock cause there was no point, coming home at dinner-time.  My life changed because I didn’t have much to do.

Yeah, how was the business affected?

Dramatically because we just couldn’t do anything at the beginning.  Um, we fought to get jobs for the staff in the Ministry,  which took a heck of a long time, it was very frustrating.  Two of the partners went into the Ministry and we decided between us that I’d stay on at the business, so I was the only one there er, going from being nine people about I was 1.  So yeah it was isolated to a certain extent but in another way I enjoyed that because I had the contact with the people.  I felt I could keep up with the rules and regulations and do whatever I had to do so you felt important as well.  But it was all a lot different, but it was different for everybody because they were all doing different jobs as well.  And they were frustrated being in different jobs, they’d been used to being their own boss and being able to make decisions and in Defra, no decisions could be made, they were frustrated.  But I was involved in that because the partners used to meet up and we’d talk and I could hear what they were going through as well, so that was quite good, you know and we could have a laugh about it, which was the important thing you know.

You must have built your business up over a long time?

Yeah, we did, 10 years, 10 years and overnight it went.  We had the business valued it was, it was valued in December when Foot & Mouth broke out in February, the December before we had it valued in excess of £300,000.  And during Foot & Mouth we had it valued again and it was worth £50,000.  And we knew because the business wasn’t re-sellable, nobody would buy it and that was the main aim especially sort of with the future towards retirement to build the business up as a saleable asset.  We built it up from nothing in the beginning, we had nothing when we started and we built it up to be that value and overnight it just went.

That must have been very worrying…

Yeah, yeah, it was worrying but there again it gave you an incentive it gave you something to aim for because as I said before life had become a bit mundane but then again you have a challenge again.  So it was interesting, it was um, as I said I felt really sorry for the ones in the beginning that went with Foot & Mouth.  But as time went by and all the rumours, speculation and everything that was going on, I began to change my views, I became more concerned about the ones who were left.  Um, you know they really struggled, they really er, you know were in a desperate situation.  I mean even disinfectant, they had to buy their own disinfectant.  The ones who’d gone down, who had the compensation it was compensation, um, they had nothing, there was no help for them, they couldn’t move anything, they couldn’t sell anything and they were in …… well I put them on par with us because we couldn’t do anything, they couldn’t do  anything.  And it was the unknown.  The people with Foot & Mouth, yeah it was horrible, they had the cows or whatever stock slaughtered.  But they could move on with their lives.  When they knew they had it, there was a future but anybody else was stuck, we were stuck for months and months and that was ….. well it was, the business is like ours, or the people who still retained the stock had no future.

Were you getting any information…

Only with hassle a lot of hassle that we had.  I mean, we’ve always had quite good contacts and we know people in various departments and that.  But um, it was only through purely just keeping at people to find out what was really going on.

So when did you start working again?

Yeah, we were slowly allowed to, started disseminated.  A lot of it we weren’t allowed to go on farms, which again we didn’t want to be responsible for spreading Foot & Mouth, nobody did.  Um, and we were very conscious you know of that.  But we were allowed to do certain things as time went on which weren’t feasible because we had to have again conformed by regulations we had to have different premises, it was all cost, which again we didn’t want to incur more costs when we had no income anyway.  Um, so it was round about November we were actually allowed to start and it slowly built up, yeah there’s restocking and that but during Foot & Mouth there’s been various alternatives to using in the AI [Artificial Semination] service and people have used them and probably they will keep with them.

Right, do you think they’ll continue to use them?

Yeah, yeah, you can’t blame them.  An AI service did not make money it runs as a loss it’s the sale of semen and other product’s which keeps the business ticking over.  Prior to Foot & Mouth I wouldn’t have ever said to a farmer you know, “buy our semen or whatever” but now I will definitely, I have no qualms about saying to a farmer, “you support us or we’ll go” its as simple as that.  And gone are the days when we used to run about and do things for nothing, we can’t afford to do that, we’ve changed the whole structure of the business.  And its allowed us to do that we couldn’t have changed  ……  Before we did have some things that were uneconomical as time went by er, we couldn’t have changed them without a lot of problems.  But because of Foot & Mouth we could do it.

Have you had any help?

Yeah,  I mean all the money that’s banded about and all the millions and that that’s mentioned a lot of its, when they start looking into it, yeah we got £8,000 we applied for 8,000 we could have had a lot more, but it was a bank loan and we don’t owe money, we have no overdraft.  We have never been in a position of owing money to anybody and we didn’t want to get into that position.  So yeah we’ve got £8,000 a marketing grant and we had a web site and we improved our computers, did a brochure.  But if we couldn’t have marketed we wouldn’t have lasted 10 years.  We didn’t need money to market but it was there and we utilised it, whether or not it’ll be any use in the future um.  We also a wonderful fund, the Addington Fund, they were absolutely brilliant, they really were good.  And I mean he still keeps in touch the gentleman concerned, his lovely.  And I mean I just purely met him by sitting at a, cause I really made, I’d got to keep Insem [insemination]  going, I had to keep Insem highlighted to be there because everybody had too many other things to think about but I had to still keep the name going.  And so therefore I went to television and radio and kept highlighting it.  I met this gentleman from the Addington Fund at one of these things and he was brilliant, really was.  And it’s a wonderful organisation, I’m sure it will have helped an awful lot of people. 

How do you feel about the future of the company?

Future of the business?  Um, its an interesting time its gonna be wholly different than it has been for the last 10 years.  But I think we’ve all really realised that we’ve just got to go with the flow, whatever happens we’ll adapt.  If, if at the end we don’t succeed it’s through no fault of our own.  Um, we’re gonna give it our best if you know we’re not there, they’re not there, but that’s all we can do.

Looking back now do you sort of think, how did I get through that?

Sometimes,  yeah, sometimes.  Um, because I’d go home and your mind would be full of it.  I’d ring people at night, the phone never stopped, , the phone was the lifeline for everybody.  Um, and you’d be on for hours um, and yeah you felt drained, everybody felt drained I think.

So what got you through?

I don’t know, I suppose talking, talking to other people really.  It depends what type of person you are.  I mean,  I am quite an emotional person you know, and my voice breaks before I do, but I am, but I’m an angry person, I can be angry as well and I have fought so hard sometimes I was so angry cause I think this is it, everybody went through the emotions of tears and feeling down and depressed and then you’d get angry.

What was the worst thing about last year?

Frustration.  The lack of knowledge of people.

The rural community or the general public?

Both general public.  It didn’t matter where you went if you were standing in a queue buying a loaf of bread or in a shoe shop or whatever, everybody talks, overnight everybody was an expert and t hey weren’t.  The majority of people had no idea and it was you know, you just wanted to tap somebody on the shoulder and say, “no you don’t know that’s wrong” you know.  And there was so many ignorant people, they weren’t ignorant …… they were only ignorant because they didn’t understand and Foot & Mouth disappeared off the media and whatever and its been cleared up in about June because the tourist industry had to get back on track and there was so much highlighted about the Tourist industry.  And that used to annoy yer.  I mean I’m a walker, I walk the fells, there was no way I would have walked, I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t have done it.  Um, so no it was, I don’t know it was a combination of things really. [laugh]

I think the tears, the tears of people.  Er, just because you couldn’t, all right you could talk but you couldn’t comfort people you know, you couldn’t.  I mean the majority of our customers, I would walk pass them in the street I don’t know them, I don’t see them, so I don’t know them, I know the voices.  I know if what the wives are called,  I’d know if they went shopping to Newcastle last Tuesday but I don’t know what they look like.  And yet I’m so close to them even though I don’t know them.  And that’s what it was they were phoning up just to speak, just to have somebody to talk to.  And I think that was happening in a lot of firms.

But I guess in a sense it was different, they were used to talking to you on the phone anyway.  It must have been quite natural to ring them and chat?

Yeah, yeah, because I don’t think of the customers as customers they’re friends, even though as I say I don’t know what they look like, I don’t. It was, it was finding the right words to say to people you know um, to sort of sympathise but cheer them up and its getting a happy medium really.

But at the same time you obviously had problems with your business as well

Yeah, yeah, I mean luckily we were fortunate we could still, financially we could still pay ourselves.  We did feel concerned that we might have to pay redundancy to our staff.  But again we were thinking about (185) and redundancy would(185) would have crippled us.  Um, but fortunately I mean, they all went off and did other things and that didn’t happen in the end.  But I mean it could have cost us a lot of money to have to pay redundancy.

Have you got any staff working for you?

We only have one.

Do you think you might have more by the end of the year?

No, there just isn’t the work.  And as I say we’ve changed business to be more economical, so no.  I’ve always wanted in 7 or 10 years to get bigger and bigger and better and now as we got bigger over the years we became in effect less profitable.  Um, because once you have to pay more staff wages, more vehicles, etc, and if your not getting the revenue back in for that increase.  So by staying smaller um, we should go back to being more profitable.

So I suppose it’s given you an opportunity to think again about everything…

Definitely complete revamp of the business.  Um, we were the first AI service in Cumbria to start up as an independent in ’92.  Before that it was all a monopolised industry.  So we had a vast knowledge and everybody that’s set up after us has contacted us or come in and we’ve shown people and things like that.   And as I say I’ve always wanted to get bigger and now we’re gonna go back to being probably one of the smaller.

Um, do you think that the general public considers that FMD had gone away?

I would like to think it is.  I would like to see April come round and get April, May out of the way, I don’t know, I don’t know.  I mean, I’ve heard this week that TB has been brought into the cattle, with a herd.  And that’s a worrying fact.  What else is imported?  Er, I don’t know.

Do you think people realise that it’s still affecting businesses like yours?

No not at all.  Not unless the family or somebody whose directly involved, no.  Er, because businesses like ours haven’t been given the publicity, its tourism yes, always tourism, but they are not thinking about the stone-waller, the mole catcher, little businesses, that are all reliant on farming.

Do you think that the farming community pulled together?

Yes definitely.  The farming community has always been renowned for being so close, would do anything for anybody, er cause there’s been so many fall-outs in the families.  And that’s because ones gone down with Foot & Mouth and had compensation, etc, and bragged about it and the other ones struggled on to survive doesn’t go down very well its human nature.  So yeah, I think they’ll be vast changes in farming community which is a shame because as I said it’s tight-knit, they’re all inter-related, they’re all inter-married.

Do you think things will ever get back to normal again?

I don’t think we’ll know farming as farming anymore, a normal, what is normal?  It’s a whole new world, and I think farming needed a new world.  I just hope it’s a better world really.

Did you ever feel like things were moving outside your control?

Yeah every day at the height of it.  Um, as I said the other night I can remember sitting down and drawing circles on maps and saying, “right well I might as well shut down”.  Er, we couldn’t shut down we had semen stored in liquid nitrogen, we couldn’t shut the door and walk away, that was other people’s property that we had.  Um, you know and just like I said this farmer’s wife who walked up and down the road for hours just lost, just thinking the whole stock would be slaughtered.  And again everybody phoning everybody and flicking tele-text and watching Nick Brown stand up in the House of Parliament with a proposal and changed what it said and everybody had video’d it and rewound it and er, it was just unbelievable.  All the little episodes like that.

Looking back now, do you feel you had any confidence with people who were running the FMD operation?

No, nobody.  The only confidence I ever had in anybody was when er, I have forgot his name, which is awful.  Birtwhistle, no, came in.  And like everybody and I’m sure he must have had thousands and thousands of letters because we wrote to him, and said, “thank you”.  And I think Cumbria breathed a sigh of relief when he came definitely.

What about MAFF?

Absolute crap.  Really useless.  The higher management should have been got rid of, yes, the government were under stress and strain I understand it just completely overwhelmed them but they didn’t utilise the people they could have utilised.  They had people who knew the area like the back of their hand and yet they were using people off the street and hadn’t a clue where the places were.  I mean, I’ve met a vet from America and she knocked at my door when I was living in the country then, one day and asked me where to go and that.  And she came in, and she’d been set up with a map and just go and she’d been driving round the countryside for four hours and she just wasted four hours you know. And yet it must have been awful at DEFRA sitting at the phone and getting the abuse and everybody, cause I mean I was phoning a lot and I was one person, multiply that up.  But instead of, I mean, we’ve got a computer programmer and she’d even tried to get into to improve their programmes on their systems because everything you asked them they couldn’t find the information, they just didn’t have the computer ……. They weren’t using technology enough to help them.  And they had standard replies it was obvious they were reading off a piece of paper and things like that and you felt at the end you knew more than they did, which often you did.

Yeah.  What about DEFRA now?

DEFRA will never alter, when it was MAFF, DEFRA doesn’t matter what you call them um, to a certain extent they’re all built in the same mould, the old civil service, the ones who’ve been in there a long time, you won’t alter them.  It’s got to have a clean sweep and change completely.  Yeah they’ve got to have rules and regulations everybody admits.  I mean, our rules and regulations are supposed to be reviewed three years ago, before Foot & Mouth hopefully they might get round to doing it now.  But no unless DEFRA changes and I’ve yet to meet one person if there was anything good to say about DEFRA.  The Field Officers, the slaughterers,  the people who were on the farm amongst the …… the ground people yes speak highly of them or the majority they do but not anybody in authority you know.

What do you think about the way the media handled FMD?

Border Television was absolutely excellent they really were.  In a way they seemed to stick to high profile people which was probably wrong to a certain extent.  They had the NFU representatives always on and the same …… they weren’t getting to the average people, yeah, it was the same old people.  And then MAFF got criticised because it looked as though they were just after glorified sort of life really.

Right, did you listen to Radio Cumbria?

Hmmmmm yes.

And what did you think about their coverage?

We were on Radio Cumbria about four times.

Were you?

Yes, yes, I thought it was good, very good.  And they went out and spoke to, they spoke to little cafes, they spoke to businesses like us, yeah they went out and they got the individual, so they were very good as well.

Right…

Yeah, yeah because people can relate to other individuals but when you keep getting, they had a few officials keep coming on same person time after time, you know, you needed the individuals, you needed somebody to come out in a Cumbria accent and say, “oh its great” you know and they were just down-to-earth, normal, “me wellies aren’t dirty anymore” your not having some sort of, “oh we had this discussion and er we have decided to” [speaking in a posh voice] you know ……  You know they were just normal, every day people and that’s what people wanted.

Do you think a lot of people’s lives changed as a result of Foot & Mouth?

Yeah I think personally as well um, I mean it made me, well whether it was Foot & Mouth or not but I mean I do probably put it down to that.  But, when Foot & Mouth started in February I didn’t realise in July that I would be walking out on me husband after nearly 30 years. You know and that was circumstances.  So I mean I’ve been married nearly 30 years and on July 23rd I just thought enough’s enough and I walked, I had no clothes, I had nothing.  And yeah things worked out but I think it made me um, whether Foot & Mouth and how life was at that time gave me the courage or the confidence or just to think, well life’s short, enjoy it and I don’t think I’d have done it.

Right, so last year had a dramatic effect on your life?

Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Yeah, and knowing um, that I had to go and tell me family and everything that went on at that time you know, me husband was in two days of me leaving, took an overdose which was er, bad.  You know all that emotion.

It must have been a stressful time all round for you?

Yes well I had nowhere to live, I had no clothes, I had nothing, just I had an un-secure income cause I didn’t know what I was gonna get from the business and yet I still did it.  I must have been made to a certain extent.  But um, you know it just makes you think.  Now when I look back I never thought I would have such a nice place as this and life can be so different.  I’d been used to coming home, cleaning, cooking, washing, ironing, doing the garden and now I come home and I can tidy up in five minutes.

I was going to ask you whether you thought anything good has come out of Foot & Mouth?

Yeah, be good or bad I don’t know, time will tell really.  But yeah I’ve moved on in my own personal life, I’ve kept the you know, what I have probably always known I had to do but couldn’t do.  Um, and it made me do something about the future.  Um, so yeah I can just see, well hopefully, I mean still, everything is still up in the air and there’s still an awful long way to go for everything to be sorted and that.  But yeah I see that personally, hopefully is gonna be a good thing for the business.  Again hopefully its gonna be a good thing because its gonna hopefully make it more profitably because we’re gonna change the working practices.  Um, we won’t be as tied to work as we were.  So yeah, the future is different, a lot different.  Er, but you’ve got to be positive and hope it is gonna be better.

Um we talked a bit on Thursday night about this project and what might come out of it.  I don’t know if you can think of anything that you feel should come out of the project?

Well I think I was probably very cynical and I am cynical because you’re always conscious of, there’s always this money being spent and all these reports and researches or whatever and nothing concrete ever comes out of anything, nobody listens to anything.  Um, yeah I would like um, but at the end that something is listened to and you can see “yeah by taking part in this, this happened or this affects this”.  Not it’s a load of paper and it’s a load of people going round and just wasting, well not wasting time but being paid to do research but at the end of it, its all shoved in a drawer and nobody ever reads it.  But we’ve all been paid, we’ve all got this grant and whatever, but what’s the point of doing it if there’s no concrete thing at the end of it?

Yeah.  What are the lessons do you think?

That the people who were directly involved and affected should have had more help at the time definitely. 

What sort of help would have been useful?

If they’d been somebody or a department or something that um, had been more knowledgeable.  There has been a meeting, I know that wasn’t possible cause people weren’t going anywhere because they didn’t wanna move.  But I remember going to some meeting, you know, sort of like for people who were complaining about things and they were quite militant and you didn’t want to be involved with those people, you wanted to be there just to sit and …… an informal chat really, you know what was needed, just for people to get together.  I mean in all the villages round here and all the villages that were affected, there’s the village hall, they weren’t utilised, you know, they could have had village hall meetings and just a cup of coffee, a biscuit, just to get people together.

Through people that might be…

Yeah, yeah, and there again same old story people moan about these things and then they’ve got an apathy that they just won’t go along, you know if somebody organises something just don’t go along, they don’t support it because they say, “oh no I’m not going”.  Just like me, I’ll come to yours, I’ll be interested and whatever, but my other two partners don’t wanna know.  And that’s because they don’t want you know they don’t see the  reasoning  behind it and that’s what your get amongst most people.

Can you think of anything else that might have helped you through?

Proper financial assistance not packages.  Yeah it took us a long time to get our rates deferred.  Um, and even now we don’t know really what’s happening till next year or what.  Um, the companies that we dealt with for our cars, um and sort of leasing the building and anything financial that was a problem that we had commitments to.  It would have been nice if they could have been sorted out a lot easier than it was, cause that was another hassle of trying to sort out our commitment.  Um, you don’t want a bank to …… well we didn’t want a bank to lend you money, we just wanted to be able to er, pay our own way.

Was your bank supportive?

Yeah, yeah, I went in to see them.  I mean, financially we’ve always been sound and we’ve had money in the bank you know, so I mean we had a good background to do that.  We didn’t get to the stage that we needed an overdraft or anything.  But we could have got to that stage but we didn’t but it was only by our own means, by cutting everything to the complete bone, which we did.  It was about April time when we realised things were gonna drag on and we just cut everything down as far as we could.

Um do you think that your health’s been affected by the events of last year?

Probably but it’s. . . . which events really.  Um, well I was, yes I was definitely going through the menopause I think before Foot & Mouth and I was getting hot flushes and dizzy spells and all things like that.  And that stopped.  And I put that down to less stress really which sounds daft er but it did stop.  Um, yes, smoked more, definitely smoked more and I drank more definitely.  Um …….

Due to the stress?

Yes

Well I did stop smoking actually for about 8 weeks but I’ve started again.  Um, yeah, no they are reasonable acceptable now.  But they weren’t acceptable, they weren’t definitely.  I mean, I was coming home sometimes from work 2 o’clock in the afternoon and having a drink you know.  I didn’t want one but I had one because it was just, you were getting rid of the time you could sleep without thinking because when you slept you thought.  I mean a few times I woke up crying for no reason, no reason at all.  Um, and I’d never done that in me life and I just put it down to what was going on.  Um, but no I mean drinking was getting absolutely ridiculous, really was, so yes.  And once personal circumstances to Foot & Mouth had eased that was able to be controlled.  But I wish I could give up smoking now.

Did you ever try and get any professional help?

No, no.  Um, I think because I’d changed home in the middle of this and changed doctors as well.  I think when I went tot he doctor’s for a repeat prescription for something else um, and I read on the computer that he’d got “business suffering, marriage problems, but seems to be coping” and that was about it.  And I thought yeah.  But yeah, no, I did cope you know but no it wouldn’t have been a doctor or it would have been more friends or family that I would have spoke to, not a doctor or a nurse, I think because they are close to you they can understand.

What do you think about the future now?  

I have different days, um yeah I think, I do feel positive because it’s a whole new world to me, everything’s new.  It’s not just the business its personal life as well is new.  So yeah I’ve got to be positive about all of it, because it’s all new.  Um, so yes I mean its gonna be different and that but hopefully at the end its gonna be better.

Um is there anything I haven’t asked you, that you think is important?

No I don’t think so.  Um, as I say it’s more the emotions that strikes  me about Foot & Mouth, its people’s emotions that is the biggest thing.

Do you think the general public understand the relationship between farmers and their livestock?

No.  Well because to the general public animals are slaughtered food, they don’t realise the dairy cattle stay in a herd for, can be 10, 12 years and that a farmer handles that cow at least twice a day, it’s like a pet.  Um, but they just see it as a food chain, well it was gonna be slaughtered anyway, so why worry?  But dairy cows aren’t sheep, they are a different aspect, except the hefted sheep or the minor breeds those are probably the exception.  But dairy cat ……. Anybody would have got rid of the sheep and here they were queuing up to give their sheep away to save the cows.  Um, but cows, they just were, the public perception of cows wasn’t right, they didn’t understand, but that was lack of knowledge.  Why should somebody who lives in the middle of Manchester understand you know, a cow is a cow, and that’s it.

Do you think the public was generally on the side of the farming community during Foot & Mouth?

At the beginning probably but as money was bandied about and how much compensation that people were getting, especially when individuals mentioned millions and things like that, that really annoyed people.  And um, sort of why should they pay?  Why should farmers get it?  You know if um …….

…. Cows had been slaughtered and they couldn’t tie the two together or get the perception of it.  Yeah, which is, it is a shame that um, even someone, I mean I’m talking towns-people, its not always necessarily towns-people its even people who live in the country and who don’t have any association with farming.

Yeah.  What do you think of this issue from the perspective of small businesses?

It’s a very big issue er definitely.  Um, I mean I think again you have your own personal view but to me we are unique because we were licensed by DEFRA to be allowed to work and they stopped us working and their actions  ruined our business.  So yes compensations a big issue to small businesses and I don’t think …… it’ll probably go on for years.  But yeah I think a lot of small business’s will fight to get compensation.

Are you going to fight too?

Yes we are yes.  Er, we had our compensation claim in with DEFRA from April of last year and we keep following it up.  We were told, and I’ve got letters from, I mean I’ve written to every minister, European Parliament, Prince Charles, President Bush, I’ve written to everybody um, and we just keep getting standard reply saying there’s no compensation for related businesses and things.  But we now, with a group that are putting an action together so hopefully something ….. but yes, a lot of businesses will claim definitely to try to.  And I think well that’s the only way that we are gonna recoup what we have actually lost.

In some ways it must seem frustrating that farmers got compensation?

Well compen…… will I prefer to, like they say compulsory purchase.  The stop was compulsory purchase, there is no doubt about that, it’s the evaluations that were given on those animals and yes some of the blood lines will never get back, but some of the figures that they were given were absolutely ridiculous.  Um, and it was a case of knowing which value to get, to get better price and all this.  I mean all this was bandied about, I mean, they weren’t daft and all the um, the way that the farmers had boasted about it, that is the frustrating thing.  There’s been young farm lads going in pubs and singing “we’re in the money” in pubs.  You know, and I mean, there’s been two or three really I’d knock to bits because people are so angry that …… and that’s when you can understand why people have no sympathy because they’re bragging about ……  There’s never been as many new cars, new tractors, conservatories go up in Cumbria than there has this last year.  You know it does annoy people when they’ve had businesses that have struggled.  And the £15 an hour that was set as a claiming thing, I mean, farmers would have done that, for £7 an hour most farmers were losing money hand over fist, they would have grabbed their hand off at £7 an hour.   But you’ve got everybody jumping on the band-wagon you’ve got people coming from the dole.  And people all of a sudden they were a cleaning expert, they had cleaning teams 30, 40 people and they sat back in an office and employed people for a fiver an hour and were getting £15.  And they were just raking it in.  You know it just always seems so unfair.  But as well after saying that it wasn’t their fault because that was the money that was set, that was what was put down.  But there was no control over that, there was no monitoring of, well there was a monitoring at the end of it but I mean, a lot of people could have said they worked 40 hours and they worked 10, you know it wasn’t …… they didn’t have the resources to monitor it but they just accepted everything.

How do you think politicians handled this?

David McClean [Pnrith and the Borders MP] was absolutely brilliant and I was never a lover of David McClean er, but he, and I don’t think anybody in the county would say any different, his been absolutely brilliant through Foot & Mouth.  Um, Tim Collins down at Kendal was also very good, um I don’t know who the Labour person is round here, but you never heard from him.  Um, or anybody else, Liberal Democrat or any of these.  Er, the European Parliament, the Labour person they had was really good he wrote a few letters on our behalf.  Um, but no David McClean was outstanding definitely.  And I think he must have, I remember phoning him the day that Nick Brown stood up and said, “all cattle in Cumbria would be slaughtered” and I phoned him in London and I couldn’t get through.  I tried for seven hours.  And I did get through to him and it was an answer machine and obviously everybody in Cumbria was phoning him and he phoned me back at 10 o’clock at night.

Did he?

And he said he’d been inundated and he had, I know he had and yet he did, he phoned me with just a little thing saying “is it true?”  You know, and he did, he kept in contact, he um, he followed letters up, he was enthusiastic I saw him at um, we went to his clinic and I spoke to him and the papers were piled high and yet he still had time for you and that.  So he was, he was really good.

Was that important?

Yes, yes, when you felt that the government was completely useless and not in control that somebody, somewhere in that position in Government, even though they were in opposition would be fighting.  So yes it was important

Er, have you got anything to ask me?

No,  not really no.

Thanks a lot for that.

I do go on ……..

As it was a Saturday, the whole family were at home to meet me and I was very warmly welcomed.  Home is a large bungalow meticulously maintained. At the back there is a large grassy area and some outhouses where M's collection of birds (various freshwater birds, ducks etc) live. We sat in a spacious living area with large windows overlooking the front rockery.  An open fire burned brightly and the family black Labrador was stretched out on the fire rug.  After sharing some tea N, M's wife and their two teen-age daughters, made their excuses and left M and I to carry out the interview.

So where I usually start is by asking you to tell me a bit about you and your background?

I’ve always lived here all me life in Silloth.  Lived, say, two mile down the road when I was born and went from there on the airfield, which is half to three quarters of a mile down the road and we built a bungalow in 1980 and we came here, and that’s why I’ve really known all the farmers all the time, and I know most of the farmers from here to Carlisle.

Your own family, are they from farming background?

No.

Your Dad?

Well we had smallholdings and that.  Me grandfather, he’d a small farm.  Well I say a small farm, it was only about thirty acre, but there again when they were farming [PAUSE] it was in the Forties…  That was just two mile down the road, so we’ve always been…

And did your Dad do farm work?

No.  Me dad he was on the Air Ministry, Fourteen-MU.  Me Grandfather he was at airfield, then me Dad was, and then he went to Fourteen-MU.  

So your Granddad farmed but he also had a job outside of farming?

Aye he was.  Seen some queer changes like, on the airfield.  I can remember the airfield when all the lights and that were working up the runway.

So do you have any memories of the 67-foot and mouth out-break?

The only memory I can think, and I don’t know why, but it always sticks in my mind, I can remember when they buried them at B farm.  They came right out the farm, right across the road and buried them in the field right opposite and that’s always stuck in me mind, I don’t know why.  That was the only really farm that I can remember of.  This was terrible this time like.

 So you went to school round here?

Yes Silloth.

And you left school at sixteen?

Yes.

What about work?

Been on caravan park, then I was driving for a bit and delivering caravans, then I was at C Mill.  I’ve worked in one or two factories but I just like working outside, can’t do with being stuck inside.  I’ve been on wagons for a bit, on them for quite a few years.  Been on the Council for eighteen, nineteen year. 

And this is the contracting work? 

Yes.

And your wife is she local also?

Yes.  She’s from Silloth, N.  She used to be a midwife and now she just does part time work at a convalescent home.

So did you know each other from when you were quite young?

No not really, no.  Just [PAUSE]  been out one night and just met her and that was it.   

You’ve got two daughters is that right?

Yes.

And they’re?

Brilliant.

And how old are they?

J is fourteen and A’s eighteen.

And A is still at home is she?

Yes.

Is she working?

She’s at college and she works at D’s when she gets time off and weekends.

So have you got a lot of farming friends?

Oh yes, a lot.

From this area?

Yes.  I shoot a lot of crows around here so  I know most of the farmers round here.  The farmers when they want the crows shot, when they’ve been sowing barley and wheat and all the crop.

So a lot of your shooting involves pests is that right?

Pests, yes.

How did you get into that?

Just after I left school I went to work on the airfield, on a chicken farm, and the fellow who was there, he done a bit of shooting, and I just started shooting with him, and I still go shooting with him, and that’ll be thirty-three year ago.  He only lives down the road, the other side of A, five mile away.    I just like country life, you know, and for the foot and mouth, I just thought well, to go and do what I did do wasn’t very easy, but it was just my bit to say well I’ve done mine for the farmers.  

If we go back to the beginning of this foot and mouth crisis, what was your first memory?

Well I would say when we first started, they’d been shot and they’d been left for ten, nearly fourteen days, some of them, and I wouldn’t have anything to eat for the first three days, you just couldn’t stomach it, then after that, queer thing to say, but you got used with the smell.  I used to come home and I could hardly smell it on us and as soon as I walked through the door I just stripped off.  It was absolutely [EMPHASIS] horrendous like, to see it, it used to just cling to you.  But it’s just… if I hadn’t done it, and if nobody else had done it, the job would never have got done.  I think with kinda sort of shooting and that, it did help, because I was used to it, you know.

Before you started working through the Council, the job that you did, when it very first hit the news and there was an out-break, can you remember what was going on here for you?

Well here, when it first started, it come on the news and it was over North East more or less and I can always remember when it got round to sort of Carlisle area.  Obviously all the farmers and that, everybody was panicking because the Government wasn’t doing, as far as I think, what they should have been doing.  They kept saying, oh we’ve got it under control, and well bluntly,  they didn’t have it under control.  If they’d jumped and done the job properly at the start, even with all the animals that they shot, they needn’t have shot half of them, because I know farms, I know farmers who’s had had foot and mouth and six inches of breeze block wall, and next doors never even gone down.  I always remember one night it came up on the television, when it was just starting to get round here, they’d been doing a few and said, oh we’ll have to do a three-kilometre cull, and they were going to extend it to about ten mile, and I thought well that’s a waste of time really, and that very night it went eleven mile.  It just went from one place and it went up about eleven mile the other side of Wigton, and I thought, well doing a three-kilometre cull wasn’t going to do much.  I mean I [EMPHASIS]  went to a lot of farms and I was loading them and they were shooting them and they didn’t even have foot and mouth.  You know, I mean I‘m talking farms were they had seven, eight hundred cattle, three or four thousand sheep, well to me that was just absolute, sheer [EMPHASIS] waste.  I think the farmers would have accepted it more if all the ones that had of been clean and gone in the food chain and the public had got something out of it…  Like the way things are now with foot and mouth, you know, the way it’s been in Britain, we should have been eating beef ‘til end of our days, instead of just shooting them and just wasting them, because there’s nothing wrong with it, that’s my opinion, some folks say there might have been but…

 You work for the Council anyway, but what is your everyday job?

Well, everyday job, well it could be tarmacking, it could be putting kerbs in, could be drains, you know, a lot of the time it’s… 

So it’s quite heavy work and it’s out of doors?

Yes.

Can you remember how you got involved in the foot and mouth? 

We went to work and they did ask for volunteers.  

You had a choice?  

We had a choice, if we didn’t want to go, we hadn’t to go, but I just went.

Was the Council paying you then? 

Yes

So you just got your ordinary wage?

Yes.  We fought and fought and fought.

So how did that feel?

Not very nice when you’re working with somebody else and they’re getting nearly twice as much as you.  

Yes, that’s what I was thinking. 

 At the end they gave us fifteen pound a day but it still wasn’t… We went to work for Cumbria Waste, then they were nearly getting a lot more than us.  And they told them like, we should be getting more but they wouldn’t give us it.  That was the biggest thing like.  I think everybody should have been [PAUSE]

Can you remember when you started the job?

I can’t remember, but it wasn’t long after it started.

Was it once the army had taken over?

Oh yes we were doing it then.

And where you doing it for quite some time?

Yes we done it till more or less the ending in Cumbria area, and we were way down like, we were down at Bootle, we were down at Millom.   We were right down that way.

So through till September?

Oh yes, aye.

So were your hours increased?

Oh aye.  You could maybe go, say, six or seven in the morning, and if you were going to a farm and they were going to work, you could be there till one two o clock in the morning.

And then would you be up again the next morning?

Aye, just away again the next morning.

That must have been quite hard?

Yes, but you were maybe going the next day and if you didn’t get a job till dinnertime, but there again you were still there at work.  You could go there and if there was a job there at eight o clock you were away.

And basically you were clearing out the carcasses, and some of them had been left lying quite a while?

Oh aye.  When we first started they’d be there [PAUSE]… well yes, ten days to a fortnight.

And were you wearing protective clothing?

Yes.  They gave us masks.

And did everybody wear them?

Well you got that way, you got use to the smell and they were there to use, and sometimes if it was that bad… Well you did [EMPHASIS] wear the mask.  You always had gloves, there was no question when you went to work in the morning, if you want a pair of gloves or three pair, you got them, they didn’t say…  Because if you went to the farm and you had your clothes and that on, well you had to take all that off and leave it at the farm, so you had to have two or three pair every day.

You say you’ve got a lot of farming friends, so what was it like going on to these farms?

Well terrible really, because, you know, you think well that’s there livelihood and it’s gone.  I mean a lot of the farms where I did [EMPHASIS] do, I knew the farmers.

Was it in this area?

In this area and that was hard.  But, you know, you just went in, sometimes you saw the farmer and sometimes they never came out.  The odd one or two came out and all you could just say was, well, I’m very, very sorry for what’s happened.  We’ve just come to do a job and you try and do it the best you can, and if the farmer wants it done a different way, well you just do it the best way for him so he’s happy.

And most of the time was it alright for people that you knew?

Yes. Yes.  One or two times you would go and you would get the slaughter team there and they weren’t very good eh, but...

So you’d be there with the slaughter team?

Oh aye.  Once we saw the carcasses from the beginning and you got called up with the ones that had been dead for ten days or so, you got called up then you got four days, five days, you know, then at the end, you were sort of going, and we were maybe waiting for the slaughter team to come, and as soon as they shot them we were loading them [PAUSE], which for the smell side of it, it was a lot  [EMPHASIS]  better, you know.  But it still wasn’t very nice when one minute you see them all running about and the next minute you’re just putting them in a wagon like.

And what about the Defra people, like the Field Officers, did they have anything to do with you?

Oh yes.

And was that ok?

Yes.  The majority… Well all you had to do is every body has to just work together, and at the end of the day if you went to a farm, Defra, army blokes, well they were really in charge.  They asked you to go and do something you had to do it.

And did you get on with everyone?  Was there a feeling of, well this isn’t very nice but we’re in this together?

Well yes.  You got one or two slaughter teams didn’t do the job right.  Very, very poor I would have thought.  One or two places I did, I wouldn’t load the animals because they weren’t dead.

What happened then?

Well one particular farm, I know that they had to come and had to shoot three animals because I wouldn’t load them.  Twenty minutes later they just laid there.

And as far as you were concerned they hadn’t been killed?

They’d shot them but they weren’t dead, and I just…  I did have an argument one day with one bloke, and I said, sorry but I go shooting every week, and I says, that cow there is not dead, I said if it’s dead I’ll load it, and I just refused to load it, and the army bloke came up and I just told him the same, and at the end, twenty minutes, half an hour later, they had to come and shoot three of them again.  There was one in the wagon. They had to climb in the wagon again and shoot one, and there was two on the floor, and they weren’t dead like, they were breathing.

And when you say loading, was that sort of manually or do you have a loader?

We had a machine that was loading them, but if you couldn’t get them in the bucket you had to just get out.  Especially at the beginning when you were going and the sheep had been there a week, ten days, if you couldn’t pick them up you had to get outside and throw it in the bucket.

And presumably they were quite decomposed?

Oh yes.  They just come and pick everything up and throw it in the bucket, you know, somebody had to do it.

And then you were taking them to a disposal site, a pyre, or what was actually happening once you’d loaded them?

Well once we loaded them they’d either be going to get burned, 
they’ve got an incinerator , or getting buried.

And that was at Great Orton?

Yes.

You were often down there?

No we [EMPHASIS]  weren’t there, all we were doing was going from farm to farm loading them.  We were just loading them all the time and then the wagons would take them, and after that farm, we would either go back to the depot wherever we were based.  They would just come and pick us up with a low-loader and we would go somewhere else.

So because you were doing this sort of work what was happening in terms of your farming friends and your social life?

Well we didn’t have a social life because you were just going to work and coming back and that was it.  No you didn’t have any [EMPHASIS] social life.

But you couldn’t go on the farms anyway I suppose?

No.

So were you in contact by phone?

Yes. I spoke to the farmers by phone and if you did see them on the road, you’d see them but most of the time it was by phone.

You must have been getting exhausted?

Well you were tired a bit.

Did it affect your health in any way?

Umm [PAUSE] no not really.  I wouldn’t think it affected my health.  The smell and that, it did get you a bit like, but apart form that… Well after a while you did get use to it.  You could wash your clothes every night but as soon as you put them back on you could smell it.

So what was it like for your family?

Well that was… More or less it was harder fro N because every time I come in I had to get changed. She didn’t know what time I was coming in.  She’d probably get up in the morning and I had gone.

And she works as well?

Yes, part time.

And you’ve got teenage daughters?

I wouldn’t see the kids sometimes for maybe a week.

That must have been hard?

Yes.  You know, you were coming home and if it were that late, you were just coming home, stripping off, walking through, having a shower.  Half the time you didn’t have anything to eat because you just went to bed, you didn’t really want knout to eat.  You didn’t really fancy a big meal.

Did you lose weight?

Oh yes, it’s a good slimming diet [LAUGHTER].  Then I think, you know, you did get used to it, especially when you got, say lads that were just coming, they would say, how do you do this, and you just couldn’t really smell it because you’d been among it that long.  It’s all in the back of your mind, you know, it was there and it was absolutely…

Does it come back to you now?

Oh aye.  You think it about it every day.  It’s always there like.  Like we’ve been away, we were away well yesterday, no Thursday, and it was just nice to go away and just go along and just see all the animals what’s coming back.  Nice now just to go and have a ride round and see all the lambs, calves and that.

 So you found that very hard, not only what you were doing in your job, but also the fact that all the stock was just disappearing?

Well just disappearing, getting less and less, you know.  Well if it had kept [EMPHASIS] on going there wouldn’t have been anything left, you know.  Fortunately there was a bit here around A town were I was.  Quite a few farms what was left, which survived, which was very, very lucky.

And A town was quite earlier on, wasn’t it?

Yes.  And the ones that went out, they went out, there was ten or twelve farms altogether that survived, and that was queer.  Well just next door here, when they done theirs, theirs laid for nine or ten days.

So next door was an IP[infected premises] then?

Yes.  And no kidding, you were bad fettle even getting up to go to the toilet through night even.  It was absolutely [EMPHASIS]  horrendous.  Well they couldn’t get them picked up, and living in the country, you’ve just got to accept it, but it was rather strong like.  It absolutely stunk and you couldn’t do anything because as soon as you walked outside, the window was open and it was coming through, you got up in the night to go to the toilet it was just coming through.

Was this in the summer as well?

Hmm, because they were just out the back there, the other side of my fence.

You weren’t involved in picking those up?

No.  I done one or two down Kirkbride, which I knew, and one or two round there, Carlisle, everywhere really, Cockermouth, wherever they were, we went.  We did do one or two round here.

So really for several months it was just this very bizarre work, very stressful, and your life was just totally foot and mouth?

Well it was yes.  Because like, well you know, if you come home early, you didn’t get up because you couldn’t go anywhere really.  You know, you couldn’t go and see farmers.  If I maybe met some of the farmers in the pickup we’d have a good crack with them.  If they were coming here or going down the lonning, have a talk with them.

What was it like in S, I mean could you still go out and have a drink and things like that? 

Oh aye, but I don’t drink.  

So that wasn’t an option for escapism?

No.  The only thing was… Well, if I could get on the farms I would go shooting.

Well what happened with that?

Well I had no problem wherever I went shooting.  The farmers would ring us up to go shooting, I rang Defra up, I went right through every channel there was and I had no problem.

So that was on farms obviously that were clean?

Which was clean.  Even if farms who had been taken out and they’d been cleaned, they wanted me to go and shoot crows there was no problem.

So did you have to go and disinfect?

You used to just go to a field, take all my stuff in a plastic bag, just walk in the field, go across where I was going to go and shoot the crows, I come back, pick my wellies up, come home and I’d disinfect.  As long as I done that, it was just common sense, that’s all it was really.

Was it ok?  How did that feel?

That was relaxing for me.  Just to get away.

But was there a sense sometime, being there and the flock isn’t there?

Yes.  [A ENTERS ROOM].  It was hard but that was just relaxing for me, and I could just go and just…well not even forget about it, but just relax.

So when did things start to get back to normal?

Well we had a… [WIFE N ENTERS ROOM].  When did things get back to normal N after foot and mouth? 

 [N SPEAKS]  I don’t think it has really.  

[RESPONDENT M SPEAKS]  Like you say, the only really thing was, when I was [EMPHASIS] doing it, I was really going shooting just to chill out. 

 [N SPEAKS]  He definitely was short tempered, more so than normal.  Normally he lets things wash right over him eh, and every thing’s a joke.  You could tell if there was something bothering him, let’s put it that way.  

[M SPEAKS]  Oh it wasn’t easy eh. 

 [N SPEAKS]  No it wasn’t.  And I mean we had them sitting down at the bottom of our garden. 

And you still find it upsetting don’t you?

[M SPEAKS]  Well I do yes. I think what bothered me, a lot of it needn’t have been done.  

[N SPEAKS]  A lot it was as well, a lot of them were our friends. 

[M SPEAKS]  A lot was they needn’t have been done, that’s the hardest bit like, you know, they needn’t have gone and shot half them, you know.  If you go and cull the ones they did do, then maybe the week after, because they’d culled that many, they couldn’t get rid of them, they left other farms and they’ve still survived, so why?   

Yes that’s hard isn’t it. 

 That’s hard, you know.  They may as well have left the others.  

[NOREEN SPEAKS]  It’s like this week, I mean take yesterday for instance, well, at the beginning of the week, they shot two cows at Longtown. 

 What’s that for?  

The TB.  

Oh the TB, yes.  

[N speaks] And then you think, oh god, is this going to start now, and then yesterday they shot some sheep because they had antibodies.  You think, well it’s still on going. 

 It’s bound to be raw isn’t it, because you’re only just getting farmers restocking and of course there’s a lot of problems still with movements of animals.  

[M SPEAKS]  That’s right.  It is hard like.  This will still be hard in another twelve months time, you know, it won’t go away like.   I’ve heard of maybe farmers getting a bit of money out of it and that, but as far as I’m concerned… I’ve got a friend of mine like, and they can’t even afford to buy them.  For what they got for theirs, I think the week after, one of their relatives nearly got, well more than half as much again, and they’ve been away and they just can’t afford to buy the stock what they had, I mean the quality.

  It’s sad. 

 It is, and you know, they didn’t have any last week when I was there, they had no stock, one or two of the other farmers have, and they’ve been in India 

 [N SPEAKS]  Two of our neighbours The Hs and Willy M, they’ve given up completely. 

 [M SPEAKS]  Well Willy M didn’t have foot and mouth he just sold his.

  But because of that?  

[N SPEAKS]  Oh yes. And like they’re just… they were sisters, you know, they still had a lot of working life left in them really. 

 Do you think that has happened to some smaller farms as well?

[N SPEAKS] Well yes.  Another we know was culled, he had a small farm, he had a lovely Jersey herd and he’s gone completely. 

And some of the breeding lines have gone as well.  

[M SPEAKS] And like these animals will never be seen again, with the bloodline.  It’s alright buying all these animals but [PAUSE]  they go and buy all these dairy herds, well say if they’re buying a hundred and fifty and say there maybe ten or twenty of them, no good, well if they’re paying a thousand pound a piece for them it’s…  William J said last week, they’d been to have a look at some and they were a thousand pound each and he said, in another months time some of them wouldn’t be worth even three hundred pounds, because you know, they’re that old and you’re paying for them the same price as what you’re paying for good uns.

But just as I was saying about getting back to normal, but in terms of seeing your friends, that feeling that you could go onto the farms and your friends could come off and you could get together, was there a sense of that happening or was it quite gradual?

[N SPEAKS]  Gradual really.  I mean one of the school friends, she was a farmer and shewas taking her GCSEs last year, , so it was either she stayed at the farm and missed her exams or she was farmed out somewhere, so we offered to have her.  We had her for six weeks. I mean theirs was all killed, they were culled.   They didn’t have it, they were in the cull [contguous].  So they lost all theirs, but until she was able to go back to the farm she stayed here with us for about six weeks.  It was heartbreaking for her [EMPHASIS] and for us really, because you knew she was missing her family.  

Of course, yes. So she was on the phone quite a lot because she was here? 

[N SPEAKS] In fact that was her only lifeline really, the phone, and they had the internet at home but we unfortunately didn’t have room.  It was hard for her really, and for [daughters?].  They had to share a bedroom and teenage girls need that space.  She was from a large family, she was one of five and she really missed them.  In fact, she went home. It got to a stage where she said she was going home regardless.  The family just wasn’t coping, you know, without her, and she wasn’t coping either.  I mean she never said, or anything like that, but you could tell when she came off the phone, she would go to the bathroom and I’m sure she had a little cry when she was in the bathroom by her self.

But in terms of being with your friends now, and friends who have lost stock, either through the contiguous cull, is it still talked about?

[N SPEAKS] Oh yes. 

[M SPEAKS] It will take a long, long time before that shocks not being talked about.

And how do you feel when you go and visit people on farms now?

[N SPEAKS]  I haven’t visited many  [TAPE INAUDIBLE HERE]

[M SPEAKS]  Yes, I done a farm there at K  and they’d been there eighty year, and he said, I’ve just lost all… I sorted all the cows out for him and there was over five hundred.  He just says, we’ve been here eighty year and we’ve never had as many cattle, we’ve never had as good, they were perfect. 

 And this is dairy cattle? 

 Dairy herd and fat beasts and he said we’ve never had it good [PAUSE]  and he couldn’t go from there to where he got the bull from because the place where he got the bull from they’ve all been shot.  That was on the Scotch side.  It was a big farm like [PAUSE]   with all the bloodlines for all the bulls and [PAUSE].  And like, you know, God forbid eh, that farmer like, he hasn’t done a thing [PAUSE]  since he went down.  I don’t even think he’s going to restock or do anything, he just can’t come round to it, but his brother, he went down, and they’ve started to restock, but he hasn’t just [PAUSE]… 

It it’s so traumatic isn’t it.  

[N SPEAKS]    I mean A’s got a friend M and their father, they lost all theirs, now her parents nearly split up over it, and M is eighteen the same age as A. We felt so bad, because she had her own cattle, farming them along side and lost the lot, and she‘s an eighteen year old and she’s on antidepressants.  [AMY SPEAKS] and it’s really just come from that, she’s lost a lot of weight and everything and stopped working for a while  [TAPE INAUDIBLE HERE – A and N seated too far from microphone]. 


 [M SPEAKS]  But that would be with a lot of farmers, you know.  I think the truth came out with a lot of farmers, they’d been under a lot of stress. 

 But just what N was saying about how you were short tempered and that was you dealing with it, you know, one step removed.  I mean it was horrible what you were doing but it must have been a really stressful time.  

 Because I know when I come I absolutely stunk and couldn’t smell it eh.  

 [N SPEAKS] And I didn’t help, i wouldn’t let him further than the backdoor [LAUGHTER] and all the things went straight into the washing machine, you know, and then from there literally it was  in his underpants from there, straight into the shower, where before he was around everywhere else.  It would sort of go up your nostrils and you couldn’t shift it, you know. 

 [M SPEAKS]  You would get up in the morning and you could still taste it, but you know, well, after a bit it would just go.  You’d be having your bait when you were loading.  

[N SPEAKS] but you didn’t eat it. 

 You were saying you lost weight. 

 [N SPEAKS] He never ate anything, he couldn’t even eat his bait.  

And that’s not like you?  

[M SPEAKS] No it is not [LAUGHER], I can usually eat, but it just felt a bit too much. 

 It’s a worrying time as well isn’t it.   

It will definitely take a long long time before it gets over, but you know, I think about it nearly every day.   

Are there things that trigger it?  

Well no, you’re just working away and doing something, and just remember a farmer and what was going on here, and remember what was going on there [PAUSE].  I could pick dozens of farms up where something’s gone wrong and the vets had been, maybe been shooting sheep and half an hour later there would be one in the middle of maybe one hundred and fifty, still alive, the slaughter teams gone, and the vet,  - that was out Gosforth -  The vet was there trying to inject it and that, and it took him ages, and there was nothing wrong with all them sheep.  It was just a field dotted in the middle of nowhere, and there was sheep around every [EMPHASIS]   field there was, and he just went in there and shot them sheep because they belonged to somebody.  

[AMY SPEAKS BUT INAUDIBLE – too far from the microphone]  

[N SPEAKS]  Apart form her Mam and Dad.  Her Mam and Dad came on the farm and her and her two brothers, they bought the farm.  

M SPEAKS]  But I’m not one for saying [PAUSE]  really eh.  

[N SPEAKS]   Not about your feelings, no [PAUSE],  but he definitely… Well in all of us, [INAUDIBLE].   A and M and her friends at school and that, and her friends that wasn’t going to school as well, because they were   on the farms.  You know, even our next door neighbours, and I mean we don’t get on all that [EMPHASIS]  well with them, but it was awful [EMPHASIS]  for them, and we felt for them.  I mean we even phoned up and offered, you know, to get them some shopping.  It did sort of bring it home to you a little bit more, you know. 

 [M SPEAKS]  And maybe next week you’d be going… You’d be talking to a farmer with all his stock and you know, says to him, are you going to be alright? and he says no we’re going to get… And it would be just like sitting on a time bomb, just waiting. 

 Which is probably the worst.  

Yes, waiting, and another day would go, or another day would go, and another week would go, and then they would think maybe we’re going to get over it and then bang,   bad news come.

Do you think anything good came out of foot and mouth?

[N SPEAKS]  I think maybe a bit more community spirit. [LONG PAUSE]  I mean you did feel for them.  

[M SPEAKS]  but you think more so because we’ve always lived in the country, folk, or as I call townies, they didn’t have a bloody clue, and they wasn’t particularly bothered, because they would turn around to you and say, well what’s wrong, it’s just a cow.  When you’ve been in the country all your life it’s a lot harder.  Whoever you spoke to in the country that had a farm knew, and ninety percent of them went down.  There’s only a very, very odd one….

My final question really is what do you think about the future of farming in Cumbria?

Well I think a lot of farmers won’t start up anyway.  Them farms will go, but a lot of the other farms who are going back are going back even bigger [tape ends here].


I thanked M for his time. We had been talking for nearly an hour.

This interview took place in the kitchen of the respondent’s home. We sat at a big table. The respondent still has not replaced stock and her husband was also in the house. He joined us part way through the interview and took part in the discussion.


…what do you remember about the start of it?

My first memories of the outbreak was I was at my part-time job at the auction mart and a chap came in and said 
“Oh there’s foot and mouth in Essex today” . And I thought oh, gosh, that’s, in this country.  The following day I then heard that it was in Northumberland, and my immediate thoughts was, that’s the next county to us. Then after that things just seemed to get worse and the next day it was at Longtown which is in our own county. But even then Longtown is a long way from where I live at, and your biggest thought was ‘will it get to us?’  But yet Longtown was about 30 miles away and you thought its a long way from here and you just hoped it wouldn’t get here. (pause)

So what happened about your job, cos you work for an auction company don’t you?

That’s correct, on the Friday we heard that all livestock movements had been stopped, I got a phone call from the market saying 
“I’m sorry, erm, you’ll have heard on the news that there’s no livestock movements therefore the market won’t be operating and we won’t need you next week” . I am quite sure that at this stage everybody thought this would just be for a small, you know, few, a small number of weeks.  We then got a letter, erm, to all the part-time staff the following week and saying that the situation as they understood would be reviewed in three weeks,  so in the meantime they were sorry they couldn’t offer us any further employment for the following three weeks but they would contact us again after that.  Well, after that obviously the situation just went from bad to worse in this county and er, we realised then that there was going to be no auctions for quite some time.  At that stage looking at my own life personally erm, because my routine of the Tuesday and the Thursday going to work had gone, to be quite honest I hardly knew what day of the week it was,  I would say ‘what day is it day today?’  

Mm

And my husband and daughter would say 
“How do you not know what day it is?”  But because my routine was totally disrupted I felt it difficult to even know what day of the week it is.  This was a situation I just got used to and then unfortunately outbreaks got nearer, and they got nearer all the time.  And when the neighbour at one side got it and then another at the other side got it,  just about a mile away from us we then had to think ‘it’s not are we going to get it but it is when are we going to get it’, then unfortunately that did happen.

And up to then you’d carried on milking as normal and having the deliveries.

We did yes, erm, we never went anywhere, erm, but we had to have our milk collected alternate days and we had to get deliveries of feed and what have you for the cattle at that time.  Shopping was restricted ‘til you were absolutely desperate for shopping really, you waited ‘til you had a big list and erm, like we were never short of anything but you didn’t think ‘oh well I’ll go to shop today’, you wait ‘til you were really needing it.  When outbreaks were bad out  erm, Carlisle area and then Wigton we certainly avoided those areas, and I tended to go to Keswick or to Cockermouth for my shopping where you felt you know you were rather safer like really. But everybody did what they could to minimise the, the you know the risk of catching it like really.  My daughter was at school and when outbreaks got nearer then she had a week off. Then, because she was coming up to SATS and exams she went to stay with a friend for a fortnight who’s from a non-farming family. Erm, about ten miles from here, and they put her up for a fortnight. Then that brought us up to the Easter holidays and we felt as though we couldn’t sort of ask this friend to have her con… you know non-stop really so she’d come home for the Easter holidays.  And then the arrangement was after a fortnight at home because we weren’t leaving the farm, you know, she wasn’t travelling anywhere with it being the holidays,  she would possibly go back after that. But the week after that the outbreaks just got nearer and nearer and we decided that she’d better have another week off school at that time. So that’s what she did and in the mornings, er, I tended to, we got up and your first thought was what are we going to find when you get out there. My husband looked round the beef cattle and the younger cattle.  I looked round the dairy cattle and if I didn’t go to find him it was a good sign, and consequently, if you know, vice versa if he didn’t come to find me then we thought it was a good sign, that there was nothing amiss on that day, like really.  And..

Obviously it was on, from what you are saying you sound as if it was on your mind all the time.

Oh, it certainly was, anybody connected with agriculture or had livestock you couldn’t get away from it at all. It had affected some of our friends by that time and erm, well, if your telephone rang late at night it was a bad sign because it was somebody telling you that there neighbour had it or your friend had it, and there again, if it rang first thing next morning that was another bad sign, because you knew then it was going to be bad news for somebody.  You listened… we, well, we relied a lot at that stage on Radio Cumbria for all our information, because at that stage we didn’t have a computer and we weren’t connected to the internet.  So, we got all our information from Radio Cumbria and to be honest, many a time they listed outlying farms that had been affected and working in the auction mart I tend to know a lot of people and often you knew  8 out of those 9 people and you know it was hard to deal with.  (upset at this point)

You still find it upsetting

Erm, difference of days I think really, but  you know, it all comes back to you.  (upset here)

Have you .......

We’ll have a break. 
(switch off tape, make tea. After this break respondent was noticeably less formal and more relaxed)

You’re working at the estate agents?

Yes, I was really quite fortunate that our auction company had an estate agent’s office which is further down in the town.  In August, end of July beginning of August they’d a member of staff erm, off ill, and they had another member of staff that left to have a baby, and they offered me alternative employment in that office.  So that was a nice change, because it got some routine back into my life it erm, it gave you a purpose to get up for in the morning apart from just washing and what have you. So, yes I felt that was an advantage being able to go and work in that office then.

Were you doing your own cleaning and disinfection here?

Yes we were, er, my husband was doing it. I was helping him on the days I wasn’t you know at work at all.  He also, we had a nephew of his who was on holiday from university who would come and help us

Mm

 In the summer, then unfortunately MAFF, DEFRA as they now call it said 
“Stop cleaning ‘til we get you all a contract”

Right yes
 So we were on hold then for seven and a half weeks and of course during that time this lad’s holidays slipped away.  By the time we got our contract he had gone back again, so he was no longer there to help my husband with all the cleaning, but er he battled on and battled on and er got all the job done. But it was a long slow process because we have a lot of traditional buildings here as well, as well as the new ones, and it was the old type buildings that took all the time of cleaning like really.

Did he have, have any effects, health effects do you think, from the cleaning?  Did you notice anything?

Erm..

.... with the chemicals

I wouldn’t say too much from the chemicals but er, when he was washing then you got splattered in your face and that you, you know. Certainly the lad who came to help him he wasn’t from a farm and he didn’t realise that when you pressure washed a wall that everything got blown back in your face and what have you.  They did spend a lot of long hard days doing the cleaning, but doing it himself on his own farm he’s then sure that he made a very thorough job,  and I think that was the most worrying part that nothing was missed or anything and I feel as though he did a very thorough job on the er, on the cleaning side.

And you’re out, and you’ve had all that passed now have you?

Yes, that, we were all signed off from that on the, in the beginning of December.  But it was a long slow job, particularly with the seven and a half weeks missing, which unfortunately in that seven and a half weeks that was all in the good weather and the longer days so 

Yes

By the time we got started again it was September and er, he er, you know the days were short and nights were drawing in and it it was a longer spell doing it.

(Husband came into kitchen, tape switched off, we introduce ourselves, he gets a cup of tea and joins us at the table.)

So did, we were asking about health effects and things, whether the disinfectant bothered you, but B thought not, did you notice any other effects like your eating or sleeping.

H: Well, we certainly didn’t sleep.

What, before of after the cull?

H: I was grand up ‘til, up ‘til the cull, and then from the cull onwards we were lucky if we had three, four hours of constant sleep,  you know, you were always wakening up four o’clock in the morning, 

Mm

H: and you, you couldn’t get to sleep at night you were just er lying there, you know just thinking of, of er, of about what had gone on really.

I think when the outbreaks got nearer I had two or three nights of no sleep at all when got to this neighbour at this side and then this side and you know that was the stage you began to think well when  not if, like really eh?  Er, being dairy farmers we were used to wakening up in the morning at half past five anyway.

Mm

 But now when you have no stock then I’m afraid you wake up sooner than that and you can’t get back to sleep like really, eh.  So we started going to bed later, thinking well, if we went to bed and hour and half later we could perhaps sleep for an hour and half longer in the morning but er unfortunately that didn’t happen either like, does it?

How about your daughter?  Has it affected her?

Erm, yes I would think so, cos she used to help us out on the farm as well and, everybody had their friends out there and you know the animals were you friends. She’s certainly not as keen on farming as what she used to be, she’s sort of career choosing 

Mm

and options choosing stage at school erm, and at the moment childcare is what she’s talking about she never mentions being a farmer at all, now does she?

No, no.

But, you know its her choice at the end of the day, we wouldn’t be forcing her into anything like really, but er, she seems to have lost interest as opposed to anything else like, anyway, hasn’t she?

H:I don’t think anybody wants us to farm at the minute though,  but when you read these magazines and listen to the news and that they just er, I think they’re quite happy just to import everything really, they don’t really want farming, well not in this area anyhow, that’s the opinion that you seem to get when you talk to other people in the area, think everybody in the same, the same opinion really which doesn’t help your enthusiasm or motivation really.  But we know nothing else so we’ll start up and carry on again.

So, I think you said at the meeting, you’d bought some cattle sometime.....

That’s right.

Dairy herd....

Yeah, we’ve got a small herd found, its just a case of knowing, when we’re able to bring them here when the parlour’s sort of been reinstated 

Mm

and regulations allow isn’t it.

H: Well, thats right yeah, but I mean this is another thing you know were still waiting of DEFRA to come and erm, check our electric over, you know we were cleared on the fourth of December of disinfect, with disinfecting  and everything and we’re still waiting to er switch the electric on outside, because er

Well, its the fourth of February now .....

Well, it is that’s right

H: That’s right

Yeah it’s two months since.

H: And er we’re still waiting for them to come and er, officially check the electric over and let us progress.

So presumably are you paying for the keep of those cattle at the moment?

H: Well no, but erm, come, come the middle of February we thought when we looked at them we thought by the middle of February we should have everything in place to erm..

To move them really

H: But I mean the speed that DEFRA works er,  (laughs),  I wouldn’t like to say when er, when they’ll come.

Well they were quite happy to keep them ‘til then weren’t they, but there again their crop situation wasn’t too clever down there because of regulations last year so, something ‘ll have to be happening by then I would think anyway won’t it.

H: Yeah uh um.

Has it changed the way that you feel about work, erm, the way that you’ll be working, do you think you’ll change at all?

I think its given us, well to be mebbe a difficult one to answer that, erm your lifestyle was just snatched away from you last year. Erm its given us time to rethink some parts of it and, and what have you but er, it was just such a sudden enforced change I think that was the, you know, the shock to the system, really more than anything.  You can only sort of do with your buildings and your land what’s, you know what is suitable for them like erm depending on each farms layout and the buildings and what have you . So, as far as I can see we’ll just have to be returning to what we were doing before but  the milk prices don’t help and the regulations don’t help er,  it seems to be just er, you know, difficult situation that we’re in at the moment really. The country still accepts imports without a lot of screaming with people and they don’t seem to get checked as they come off aeroplanes and what have you, so you just think well if this situation’s caused by, you know, imports of meat what have they done to stop this from happening again?

You’re worried that it’ll come back?

Yes, I think that’s got to be at the back of everybody’s mind now if it could come back. There hadn’t been an outbreak since ‘67 or sort of thing, and before that, so it had never been high on people’s thoughts during that time but I’m sure its uppermost in most livestock farmers minds still now.

How’s it affected your wider family, do you have relatives who’re farming, older relatives?

H: I’ve got a brother who’s, well we both have er, brothers and sisters that’s farming, erm my brother’s just sort of two to three mile away from here and he, he was fortunate not to go down, 

Uh huh

H: Erm, but on a wider scale its put quite a rift between erm farming, between farmers in general, them that have gone down and them that haven’t gone down.  Cos the ones that’s been left have sort had brunt of all the, I mean we’ve had a lot of washing out and a lot of work but, unseen work, but they’ve been stuck with a lot of cattle that they’ve never been able to  er move because of the regulations right in the early days. And then when they did get chance to move them they were bringing erm, well they were robbing them of you know, for what they could‘ve got through the auctions really but because there was no auctions they had to direct to 

Slaughterhouses and that

H: slaughterhouses and you know, and they weren’t paying a fair price for them really like.

Its also cost them a lot for disinfectant and what have you, like to just to supply it for there own gateways and what have you, you 

Yes 

know throughout this time it’ll be gallons and gallons that they’ll have gone through like really eh, and that’s more unseen costs like isn’t it?

And then there was, you know, Over Thirty Months animals, you know when an animal goes over thirty months er its not allowed to go into the food chain, 

Yes, yes

H: well these people that were fattening cattle, quite a number of these animals went over thirty months, so they got nothing for them, you know, they just got their 

The over thirty month price

H: Yeah, ‘stead of the fat, ‘stead of the fat price which they would have been, you know, and there’s been nothing said or done about that which it wasn’t their fault that er that they lost out on that. So er you know sort been quite bit of, there’s been a, you would say a rift between them that’s gone down and them that, that hasn’t eh?

I don’t think we would ha’ like to have been the only farm in this like village or locality that had gone down.  At least there was them that had lost there stock and them that hadn’t and you know we were in contact with those that had lost their stock 

Yes

Cos we were, you know, in the same wavelength as them like really but I wouldn’t have liked to have been the only one in the village that had lost their stock if everybody else had still been farming.

Do you think there is resentment there?

I think there’s little bit in some er, respects yes, there is, but er you know those people that didn’t lose their stock they don’t have their memories of that day

H: I don’t think anybody round about feels that it was our fault that foot and mouth came into this area or, or likewise with any other neighbour.

That’s right

H: Erm you know that was just one of those unfortunate things that happened. But erm, I think its just the fact that them that still had their stock were, well they felt they still had all this extra work on and the extra burden of trying to move them from one field to another across roads and’ that which they, they just couldn’t er, couldn’t do. And a lot of them had very little grass and then we had acres of grass

Loads of grass

H: And we couldn’t er

And we couldn’t help them out with it nor anything

H: We couldn’t really use it, you know, because of, because of er the situation that we were in.

Did you make forage?

H: Yes, we did, aye,

 So it’s stored is it?

Well we’d make big round bales and’ wrap them, and’ they’re still in the field you see, we couldn’t bring them into the buildings, so they’re still out there in the fields,

H: Which was an extra expense to us because we had two good silage pits

That we’d normally have used.... years ago we used to make round bales didn’t we but we put silage pit up and got rid of that job we felt, but went back to it this year

Did you have your own machinery, or did it cost you as well to get a contractor on?

H: No, its cost us ‘cos we had to get a contractor in,

We had to get a contractor

H: Yeah, and now it’s that wet we can’t, can hardly get them out of the field.

And it was also very difficult for contractors because they had some clean farms and some, like ours which was a dirty farm, ‘and well they had a queer job, you know, deciding which order to do the, you know, their work in. And then the weather would break and you were back to square one, so it hasn’t been easy for anybody like farmers, contractors, or, or anyone at all.

At the meeting you were talking about the differences it made to your social life and how awkward you felt when you first went out again, do want to say a bit about that?

Well, at first we, we didn’t really go far but I did say we went to Carlisle one day and, Michael went to the football match and we went into the town and I really felt as though we shouldn’t have been there really because you know, you didn’t know who you were going to meet on the street. And you felt if you did meet somebody, were they thinking, ‘oh they’ve just had foot and mouth what are they doing in the town?’ I think that, that’s certainly gone and has been gone for a long time but when you’d first got it you certainly felt uncomfortable going into public places like, really eh.

How did your daughter find it going back to school?

Well quite a few of her school friends had been through the same situation she had a week off school as most, er families did when they’d suffered it like, really. So she wasn’t the only one when she went back there and, her farming friends understood the situation, those that were non farming just said er, 
“Oh you’ve got foot and mouth eh?”  and, and that was it like really because they probably didn’t understand you know what she’d been through at all. She actually did have a few extra days off because there was exams on the day that she should’ve gone back to school, so, she wasn’t able to do those erm, all of those because she just simply hadn’t been able to revise for them in the week you know, leading up to that like really.  So, but, because Wigton you know, is a school where she attends its from a big catchment area, they’d gone through cases of foot and mouth from the early days right through till the end. And the school and the school teachers were quite, you know used with coping with it because they’d been, had people suffering from it for a, for a many weeks really.

Were they quite good with them did you feel, I mean, apart from just knowing about it?

Personally I felt that they were, erm, yes even, well a few days afterwards the Head Teacher phoned here to say how sorry he was to hear that erm, that our farm had suffered from it, and also some of the teachers lived fairly locally so, they would also knew, but  you know as I say they would be suffering cases in the end of March right through until into May so, the school was very badly affected by it and by attendance at school as well, cos they’re from, you know a lot of them are from the rural area their pupils.

Do you feel anything good came out of it anything positive?

Well I think there has to be something good come out of something bad all the time. And I suppose, looking back over the year, as a family, we’ve mebbe done more things together, and spent more time together as a family because you know, not having staff then we didn’t really have holidays and we didn’t have time off together. Whereas, I suppose this last year then we’ve spent more time together as a family possibly, but you know, you don’t want a situation like that to er to arise to make that happen but, there has to be some good things come out of something bad all the time,  I hope anyway.

H: Personally, as an industry I don’t think its done any good at all, not, not a bit, I think its made it, its made it worse in fact I think.

Farming?

H: Well, yes, of all aspects you know from, from even, from being able to sell anything at the auction, you know when it does get back going again, there’s going to be more paperwork and rules and regulations and this is on top of what, what we already have to do with form filling and things like that, . And the I, the way you, you read about it then, and look at it, in the, in the past they’ve always condemned factory farming with er, the pigs and poultry sector and you, that’s exactly how those, they’re encouraging the dairy industry to go. , they’re wanting them to get bigger and bigger from you know, and everybody that’s gone out and are going back in appear to be going back in putting another fifty or a hundred cows on from what they already had,  And to me that’s not, erm, that’s going against what they’ve been saying all along about this factory farming, cos there’s no way you can really look after three hundred cows as well as you can do after, you know, fifty or sixty cows, you can’t give em the personal attention and, and the management that er, that you could er with the smaller farms.

And that’s obviously, from what you’ve said about the cattle being in your friends, it seems to be the way that you’ve farmed…

Yes, I would think so, our cattle erm, they all had names here, they weren’t just numbers they all had names and, and known individually.  And you know you could assess them, is this one better than its mother, or is it worse than its mother, if your breeding policies were following through, correctly, every one, every generation should’ve been better than the previous generation.  And having a small herd you can keep track of them and know which, you know which is mother and which is daughter and, follow the generations through.

How long have you been breeding your own line?

We’ve been at this farm since er eighty three, we started here so , nearly twenty years I suppose then really.

H: But we both had er, cow families from when we 

Before we were married, like really eh, from both our parents farms, you see when we started we sort of got something with each parent so unfortunately those are the bloodlines you cannot replace at all you see.

H: I was given one when I was seven, 

And you

H: and just bred up from it and, you know, you can’t get them, them animals back again, they’ve gone forever.

Are you going to carry on with the sucklers as well?

H: Eventually, I think yeah, we’ll just, er we’ll just build from breeding from what we’ve, what we’ve purchased we’ll just er 

Takes time to go through the bringing up process again though doesn’t it really eh?

H: But going back from what I was saying you know, with, with all these herds getting bigger and bigger, they’re just trying to er, smother the little man out really and its not going to be practical to be able to, to farm on a small scale any more.

Do you feel that you’ve got any control over that situation, any way that you can (inaudible 247)

H: Not re.., at this stage no I don’t think so, because as soon as we send our first load of milk away they’re al.., they’re already going to knock two pence a litre off because we’re not sending enough milk.

They’re going to penalise the people who’re sending smaller volumes away like

H: We’ve got so send over two hundred gallons of milk, well I should say 900 litres of milk, a day, otherwise they’ll knock two pence a litre off your er price.

Is that because of the cost of transport, is that what they ..

H: Well just because they’re encouraging you to go to

Get bigger like, really eh?

H: And this is what I’m saying you know, and then they’re sayin you can, you can put a bigger bulk tank in, keep it two or three days but then you can’t turn round and say you’ve got fresh milk any more when its been in the tank for three days, so you know, you just feel as if they change the rules to suit there selves.

It takes time to build up your numbers again you see, 

Yes

When we first get started again we won’t have anything like that quantity of milk either will we?

H: Well no, but we haven’t got the acres to keep the number of cows to get in a, you know, if you’re sending enough milk away they’ll give you a penny a litre but there’s no way that we’ve got enough acres to be able to er, 

Do that

H: To do that.

So even if you were up to maximum strength

H: Yeah

You don’t feel you can match what

H: No

They want

H: We’re always goin’ to be, we’re always goin’ be left

Difficult eh

H: Left a, left a penny, or a penny and a half less than the, than somebody that can send a lot of milk away

And these small margins are very vital for your viability like really anyway eh, penny and a half doesn’t sound very much but it is when it comes down to the bottom line at the end of the month like, 

Yes

its very vital really isn’t

Start multiplying it

That’s right, it does make a difference yeah.

H: And the way they keep going for the environmentalists,  I think the smaller farmer ‘ll look after his, his farm on, on a you know better scale than the, the large men won’t have time to, go round doing all these other little projects. Where a small man, he can you know, he can milk his, his cows, and look after his stock and then get out and erm do the fences and, you know

The hedges

H: The hedges and things like that

As they want you to do and

H: Where the big farm is more likely to erm, let two fields run into one, because, because the number of cows you know its, its er.....

Was there anything last year when things were very difficult for you and distressing that really helped can you think of anything?

Well, after we lost our stock we got over a hundred letters sent from friends and neighbours and colleagues and we even had letters and cards and things from people that we didn’t even know. And I felt that that was a big comfort to everyone, in turn I must admit I was writing my fair share to, to people also but er, it was, it was comforting to know that other people cared.  I think really, but er, this was all from your friends, your neighbours, your relations and members of the farming community.

A lot of people have said they spent more time on the phone than usual did that happen?

Oh certainly happened here, when you weren’t travelling anywhere the petrol bills were down, but I would have to say the telephone bills were up because you had to keep in touch with people also.  Either for to see how they were getting on and how it was affecting them or checking on own health or sympathising with them, so, I think the telephone was a lifeline to everyone in the farming community at that time.

And what about things like the radio, internet, television did you, did you use that for information or was it word of mouth?

Well we got a lot of our information from the radio and particularly Radio Cumbria seemed to serve us well, just where we’re situated here we get bad television reception

Mm

 Even though the television mast is just a short distance from here the signals go, sort of over the top of us. So we tune to BBC Scotland so that we can get a good picture but unfortunately such as Ceefax all we get there is BBC Scotland so we knew all about the outbreaks over the border but we weren’t getting the local information,  so yes I would have to say it was Radio Cumbria that kept us up to date with what was happening there. And at that stage didn’t er have the internet or anything so it was Radio Cumbria where we got all our information from really wasn’t it?

H: Yeah, um, cos they give a bulletin every hour I think in the morning and at five to eight

That’s right, we even had to have the radio plugged up outside, if you were still  milking so you know we didn’t miss them, because often when you got in it was mebbe five past the hour and then it was a long wait ‘til the next one like really, so yes, we er, we got a lot of our information from them wasn’t it.

Is there anything else that you can think of that was really important to you that we haven’t talked about?

I think everybody just missed the social aspect of seeing people 

Mm
And meeting up at, well say the auction mart or, various functions throughout the year. The Young Farmers all had a difficult time as well, all their functions were cancelled.  In fact sort of everything that we went to was cancelled for the year and, you just missed out er seeing everybody like really, and catching up for a good crack, it was only the telephone that er, sort of replaced those type of events like really eh.

Would you have gone to shows and things...... did you go to..

We used to go to shows and things yes, we did, so, you know everything like that was just cancelled really wasn’t it.

H: (Inaudible 320) it was sort of nine or ten months before we saw my parents, we had er, an auntie over from Australia and we had er a farewell party for her at the end of January,

Just before she left to go back, didn’t we

H: And erm, I think it was September 

Before we actually saw them again

H: Before we went back to Bothel again, to my father’s home

How far’s that is it about eight…

It’s about four miles from here like isn’t it? Yeah

Only four?

H: If that, yeah

Yeah, my sister they’re still farming, we saw them in January and then the next time we actually saw them was in November when it was their Silver Wedding, but obviously spoken on the ‘phone plenty times, but er, we didn’t actually see people like, did we, at all

H: No

Particularly those that were farming you see like eh

H: See even after we went down you didn’t want to, you didn’t want them to come here or you go there for the fear of 

Spread or

H: Passing it on to them

That’s right

Did you miss out on important things like weddings and funerals?

Erm, well I don’t really think we had so many weddings or things to go to but, erm a lot of people that we knew that were going to get married actually cancelled it for a year 

Really?

and, postponed it, but things like twenty first birthdays and that, you cannot replace them by holding it back for a year, that date is gone like really, isn’t it but

H: Other than weddings and funerals we didn’t miss out on anything because everything else was cancelled anyhow

Thats right

H: You know, everything in the farming 


Calendar was cancelled, wasn’t  it?

H: It was cancelled so we didn’t miss out on anything other than, had the,  but I don’t , I think, we, we did go to a funeral actually but they had they had mats  down at the…

That’s right, it was even difficult for those type of events that you’ve no control over like eh

H: I think we had, had we gone down at that stage or not? Arthur..

No, that was in March.It was in the beginning of March that, but there was outbreaks in Cumbria then and, personally I would’ve thought there would’ve been more people at, at his funeral had it not been for the foot and mouth situation, some people would be reluctant to travel even to that. So you know, things like funerals you have no control over when they’re going to happen so, so, its been difficult for everybody through the walks of life really

H: There’s actually there’s a one we would’ve gone to and they, they made it a private erm funeral so that nobody

Felt as though they were

H: Had to go

Yes

H: You know sort of spares you the,

Thinking

H:  should I go?


Or should I not?  The decision’s made for you like really isn’t it?

H: That was a farming…

Yes, yes you wouldn’t feel you were offending anyone

You weren’t that’s right

H: And that was a farming family that er

Lost their daughter wasn’t it yeah

H: Lost their daughter, they made that decision to, to make it private for that, I think, well for that reason really

I’m sure it was that reason, that’s right

‘Cos usually farming funeral’s they’re big aren’t they?

They are, they are 

Everybody goes

Certainly they do, that’s right.
(pause)
So are things getting back to normal socially, have you events planned again?

I think they’ll be getting back, a bit more back to normal this year like really, clubs are just sort of beginning to meet, I’d have said since the New Year really, but you know clubs are beginning to make some progress and begin thinking you know for the future

H: Well the new season sort of starts September, through into the winter months and, yeah I would think erm they’ve all sort of held meetings from then onwards sort of thing, but I wouldn’t know that the enthusiasm’s the same as it was.

J: Why is that, do you think there’s still a hang over or is it people are nervous about it coming back?

H: I don’t know that peoples nervous about it coming again, well some might say has it ever gone away really, cos I was er, I went for some er, spare parts down to Aspatria today and the man told us today that there’s, he heard that there’s been over twenty five thousand been slaughtered out since its supposed to have stopped, . That you just never hear about, I mean we did hear that there’d been two thousand slaughtered on New Year’s Eve, and we do know of other cases, apart from that one you know, but er, its just the absurdity and the worry about it, but I think peoples just er, accepted that its gone and er, you know making the most of it, everybodys trying to restock and,

Kind of get life back to normal like

H: Make a go of it eh?

J: Do you think things’ll get back to normal ?(inaudible 380)

I think they’ll get back to normal but perhaps not just the same as they were. I think they’re going to be, well such as the auction mart, they’re going to be subject to a lot more regulations and cleansing and disinfecting of what have you, but erm I don’t know whether life’ll just ever be as it was previously.

J: Its nearly a year isn’t since auction marts closed?

It is, thats right, yeah

J: Is there any sign of them opening, would you think your job’ll come back again?

Er yes I think it will, er they are hoping for the end of February but at the moment they’re waiting for DEFRA to tell them, well, all the time times going on, and you know, if there’s more regulations made then they have to have the opportunity to tell the general public about what’s going to happen and what have you, but, erm.  I think it’ll be no easier than it was and we won’t have the numbers of stock in this area for quite a time. So, it will take a long time to get back anything near normality that, was there this time last year. But, you know there’s such a lot of paperwork with cattle now, staff will certainly be needed to check all the passports and documents and what have you. But, I don’t think it’ll just be the same as it used to be. Whereas, you used to watch all these lorries and, Land Rovers and trailers bringing their cattle in, just when they had time and when they could fit it in, but, I think days like that’ll be gone now, really.

J: Has lambing started around here, have you got any lambs round here?

Well er, we haven’t really but you see there’s not very many sheep in this area either because, last year a lot of people gave up their sheep on the voluntary cull, in the hope it would save their cattle. So, people have begun to get a few sheep back but, because of the difficulties there was in the autumn for getting tups to the ewes 

J: Yeah

I think lambing, er, it’ll not be ‘til April I would’ve thought, but..

H: Well, its, its usually March April round, in this area anyhow

J:Right

But I think it’ll perhaps be a little bit later this year won’t it?

H: Anybody, that got erm, female sheep back couldn’t really get a tup to go with them, you could get tups or you could get the yows, but er you

It was difficult er, to get both at once, like eh, so

J: Mm

H: But yes, er I think that er, we have one, a couple of neighbours that’s, I think they’re due later this month, mebbe into March, so that you know  went out on the cull and they’ve got replacements back

J: Just wondered whether that might make things feel different

More normal again, that’s right, uh huh, but there’s certainly greener fields round this area because people haven’t the numbers of sheep that they, they normally have, whereas those that still have them haven’t got their numbers have they

 H: No

So, whereas often the fields are looking very brown at this time of year after frost and what have you but, they are quite green at the moment, anyway eh?

Week 1
Very busy week as we have been having a new floor put in as a result of getting money from the FMD recovery fund because our turnover was way down when we applied. Obviously this has meant that the FMD outbreak has been brought to mind again. We have had several farmers or their wives in the shop who are optimistic with their restocking although one farmer who is also in the caravan park business is not restocking yet. Our farmer friend Alistair is rushing to restock to a deadline date so that he will be able to claim the sheep subsidy even though he is unsure as to the likely profitability of the job. Good news that the Appleby Horse Fair has been given the clearance for June. Last years cancellation caused many businesses including ours to loose much money. Generally still positive about the future year ahead.

Week 2
Visited the Upfront Gallery with G. Large oil painting depicting ‘The Slaughter’ not pleasing, but brought to mind the cull again, as we were near Great Orton we decided to drive by the airfield on the way to Carlisle, an eerie quiet there now that created a feeling of unease and sadness when we remembered all the animals slaughtered – many unnecessarily. We also wondered about the effect of all the lorries going through these narrow roads for so long on the school and all the residents of this small village. Feeling somewhat depressed when I think too much about the past year which now seems almost like a bad dream. Visit by I and interview – surprised that talking about the outbreak of last year made me feel quite upset! The all consuming topic of FMD last year obviously had a greater psychological effect on me that I had thought!

Week 3
Discussion with farm wife customer whose animals were culled. She spoke at lunch get together with other farmers to discuss FMD but said that she was not interested as she now feels it should be put behind her and look to the future. Discussing FMD with people still makes me saddened and angry if discussion goes on too long.

Week 4
This week sees the anniversary of the first cases and brings back feelings of concern that I had this time last year. Fair bit of coverage on national and local news.

Week 5
Worry this week of an outbreak scare in Yorkshire – yet again the media blow it all up instead of waiting for the results. Thankfully they prove negative but the media circus out in force. More or less finished the improvements to the shop which we did asa result of money from the recovery fund. It has been an extremely busy few weeks. Positive attitude towards the future as always.

Week 6
Various T.V. programmes looking back over the FMD crisis, most pointing out the plight of the farming community but some mention about other businesses. Most farmers I come across seem to be expanding their milking herds to make a more viable unit or if small getting out. I have mixed feelings about agriculture, but I suppose it’s the general continuance of the progression to larger units and hobby farms.

Week 7
Reading Private Eye ‘Not the Foot and Mouth Report’ highlighting the lack of organisation on the part of the government to handle the outbreak, also the misinformation given by the NFU – MAFF/DEFRA concerning vaccination. The whole thing has upset me, with the response of what went on re culling the animals and the affect on the farmers involved, just angry again with the chaotic situation – what will come out of the three Government Inquiries I wonder? Positive approach needed again to wipe this from my mind. Lambing started in some places, so lets hope all goes well for the farmers, still some footpaths closed in the area but hopefully they will be open by Easter – can it be a year since it started?

Week 9
Announcement this week that support for agriculture is to change, no doubt this will cause more agro for the farming community. Border T.V. programme followed the life of a calf from birth to slaughter and the trials and tribulations of 2 or 3 farming families. Sad to see a Cumbrian family having to sell up the farm. However, the whole question of Government and E.U. support for farming is a huge subject and has gone on since the 1947 Agricultural Act to secure food at reasonable prices for the U.K. after the deprivation of food shortages during and after the war. Conservation is the name of the game and no doubt will all hinge around this. The other farming family who were part-time really, struck me (an ex-farmer) as being very inefficient and unprofessional, little sympathy there really. The final part of the programme showing graphic scenes of the animal being slaughtered and cut up were just in very bad taste, even I could become vegetarian!

Week 10
Lambing going on round and about. Farmers seem much happier that the cycle is beginning again, altogether more up-beat. Took my first walk for a year over fields near by that are stocked, first checking with the farmer that it was ok. Really uplifting to see the ewes lambing and cows calving, also curlews, oyster catchers, etc. Easter trade was up on the Saturday, mainly due to the country market that was advertised on T.V. through Spirit of Cumbria money – also fireworks in evening, which drew 2000 + people – pity we didn’t have a stall near the river selling things!!

Week 11
Busy week in the shop, especially at the weekend. Announcement of more money for Cumbria – but not clear if it’s NEW money. Frustrating that most of the money available seems to have to go for projects that have to be thought up and acted upon very quickly. Chamber of Trade meeting to discuss amongst other things the success of the market day and the fireworks. T.V. advertising seemed to work, especially for the evening fireworks. Thoughts of ‘tapping into more money’ that could be available plus contributions from businesses to hold another one next year, but also to arrange something for later in the year. I have just got lumbered with organising the buying and erection of bunting for the Jubilee.

Week 12
Becoming very irritated by Business Link, as I put in the claim for money expended on the I.T. equipment in late Feb, and I still haven’t been repaid, they just cannot cope with all the final claims. Suppose the earlier claim for the floor in the shop was paid direct to suppliers in about 3 weeks, still hopefully it will get here eventually. Beginning to get to grips with the internet and e-mail! Much to the amusement of friends. Listened to the Radio 4 programme ‘Costing the Earth’. Unfortunately I kept dozing off! But it seemed rather depressing with tales of concerns about seepage from burial sites, although it got over the magnitude of the outbreak. Around Appleby I still feel that there is a positive attitude in general about the current situation.

The Diarist I find interesting and it is encouraging that the Action Group meeting took place with the many representatives of various bodies to hear feedback from your findings to date. The piece on effluent disposal shows that the repercussions from this one site alone would seem to be going on far a long time yet – does the tanker journeys each day affect the Great Orton population I wonder?

Week 13
Met local farmer and in the past very active councillor for EDC (Eden District Council). Although they are restocking they rather enjoyed the weekends off while they had no stock and are wondering why they are restocking! Trade this week has been rather flat although generally March and April have been much improved on last year and back to normal, mainly due to one or two Border Fine Art figurines that have been in demand.

Week 14
Speaking to farm buildings erector who has had a very busy year putting up new buildings on farms that have had FMD. He reckons much money has gone into Cumbrian economy through FMD. We have had a busy week, a few more visits but mainly local sales. At last received money for IT re FMD recovery! Using computer a bit, but will eventually have to go on a course – still not sure if it’s a good thing or not, although e-mail certainly seems very efficient, but the use of suppliers web sites not that helpful as yet. Seems more time consuming than looking through a catalogue where the illustrations are better. Have been redesigning the garden – gardening  certainly relaxes my mind and is a stress buster. When I was managing the farm in Essex 15 years ago I had a big garden – not realising it I think my gardening over the last 20 years there may have helped in relieving my stress levels over the years.

Week 15
Attended the Major of Appleby’s inaugural luncheon on Wednesday, having put bunting up in the town the previous evening for this event and the Jubilee and a charter train of 600 people visiting Appleby on May 18th. The train visit has been helped by EDC to bring visitors to Appleby! At the luncheon both the Majors of Appleby and Carlisle made mention of the FMD outbreak, both hoping that visitors will be back to normal this year. Visiting Skipton this week I was pleased to see fields filled with stock, on the surface there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of animals. Undecided whether to give evidence at the FMD inquiry when it comes to Appleby next week. I normally keep a low profile at such gatherings!

Week 16
Unable to attend the FMD inquiry in Appleby as we had an important Rotary Club meeting, seemingly a good attendance, The Herald reported some evidence, the local town office painted a bleak picture for Appleby trade, saying that 2 businesses had closed down and 1 more was closing in July, as well as the fact that walkers were not returning because some footpaths were still not open – didn’t know about this. Our turn-over is considerably up on last year and even the year before, certainly we have had quite a few tourists this last couple of weeks, and the local trade continues well – we musty be doing something correct! This Saturday a charter train from Cleethorpes stopped for two hours in Appleby – 600 people!! We had a good day, as there were other visitors and locals before and after the train, all very encouraging. The train was helped by EDC with money from regeneration I think to pay for a jazz band at the station and classic coaches to bring the people to the town from the station.

Week 17
One of our farmer Rotary Club members gave a slide show and talk on FMD and how it affected his farm. Two other of our farmer members decided not to take part as they wished to forget, however, he sensibly went over the slaughter shots very quickly. He said it was a relief when they knew they had got FMD, he found the restocking very emotional, but is now looking forward with a positive mood.

Again shop trade is still much improved on last year and the year before. We are now preparing for the horse fair which takes place in about 1½ weeks time, always an anxious time leading up to it. Have just heard that the other gift shop in the town is not going to open as they don’t want the hassle and cost of employing more staff. Not good for the town really. We manage with 3 of us in the shop, but it is well worth while. Depressing start to the week weather wise, hasn’t really stopped raining. 

Week 18
Preparing for the horse fair with the extra stock and rearranging the shop. People are predicting a much bigger fare this year, as last year’s cancelled due to FMD. We always get on edge a bit at this point!

Week 19
Start of Appleby Horse Fair, very much the busier than last one in 2000. People say it's because no fair last year due to FMD.

Week 20
Exceptionally busy time over the horse fair, even better than year 2000. very wet and Lydia on the hail which worked in our favour as people are tired of walking in ankle-deep mud and then come into town. Although we were exhausted at I had fun with many of our regular Horse Fair visitors. I had a discretion with a local farmer hoping to get funding for an equestrian centre in a village, also a farmer hoping to put in an all weather trotting track so they could bring in a bit more trade to the town. discussion it also going on as to whether the redundant at Shire Hall in Appleby could become a Romany museum, a good idea but it could be detrimental to our horse fair trade, on the other hand could bring extra people to Appleby and we’d benefit.

Weak 21
I have at last bought a copy of a heart and soul, I have dipped into it but I'm not sure that I really want to read it. Even at a year on I find it quite upsetting to see in print what people went through, perhaps I should keep it for five years and then read it?

Week 22
The scare this week, or was it last, that a peak in North Yorkshire was suspect it FMD. Thankfully it wasn't, but this sent shockwaves through me. The thought of it and what action would be taken, what the country be shut down again? I wonder if there is now a strategic plan in place to deal with FMD, and what it is? Have caught one or two parts of the inquiry, Brigadier Birtwistle not pulling any punches still. Fairly busy in shop, still going well, not besieged with visitors though!

Week 23
The Wet weather there is even getting me down now! Summer is slipping by without any a warm weather. We had a summer evening rotary ball on Saturday in a marquee, very good evening but cold! This was not held last year because of FMD. Quite a few more tourists this week for some reason, I have sponsored a horse class this year at the Appleby show as I there are no sheep or cattle classes. Preparing for the rotary fun run to be held on Sunday. A friend who has a B&B guesthouse, suffering from depression and panic attacks, not sure if this can be the result of a difficult year for him due to FMD. Looking back on the last few diaries I just hope that they are some used as one or two are very sparse!

Week 24
Busy day in shop on Saturday for the carnival, turnover still holding up well to. Very good turnout in both participants and watchers for Carnival. Feeling a trifle fed up this week, as my younger brother who lives alone in Essex and suffers from anxiety and depression (has done for over 25 years) seems to be going through a bad patch, daily telephone calls going over the same ground as he has done for all these years get a bit wearing and tend to pull oneself down as the help and advice over all these years does not seem to have done any good! Still he did have about three years up to a year ago of reasonable health. My own coping mechanism in dealing with a distressed brother on the other end of a phone is easier said than done!



Week 25
A useful trade fair at Harrogate on Sunday, good sunny weather as well and beautiful gardens around the town. Our 35th wedding anniversary this week! Quite a busy week socially with rotary events so hopefully my down state brought on by my brother's woes might lift. Managed pub my brother's difficulties in the background again, only way to survive and not get depressed myself! Over the years we feel we have more or less done all we can do to help him within reason.

Week 26
It in it there has green FHM or Appleby in the local paper which has included an article on our business, very complimentary saying we are an asset to the town! Good morale booster! Many customers commented on the article saying we deserve it! We had Sunday off and went round open gardens in Ravensdale most enjoyable, called in at Hartley Pine and had lunch outside, I wonder whether they get much custom as it is rather out of the way, however, some very nice items for sale.

Week 27
I bought a Farmers Weekly for the first time in ages to read FMD reports. The Anderson report doesn't tell us anything we didn't know, however the Telegraph had an interesting article saying that the mechanism was in place to use of vaccination but the E.U and our government saw fit not to use it, I seem to recall that the NFU were very vociferous against its use, no mention in the article about them! One can only hope that lessons will be learnt and plans will be in place. Off to Essex this weekend it for a wedding of friends, I will meet with my brother.

Week 28
We attended the wedding in Essex, most enjoyable meeting with old friends and seeing the happy couple. We called in on my ex-boss’s wife for coffee, he died a few months ago, she seems to be coping well but related bad news for one of farm workers who has been there many years including my time as manager of farmer, he has got inoperable cancer, he is only 58. Arable farming also seems to be in turmoil with low prices although they still seem to be buying land if any comes up! I'm relieved that I left farming 50 years ago as I would find it very difficult to cope with the new situation, I suppose this was one of the reasons we decided to leave as we were looking for another challenge in life. We really have been so fortunate with our shop here in Appleby. Enjoyable social evening in Dalston (thanks to those who organised it) is interesting that none other people I spoke to mentioned FMD, I didn't either! Is it that most people now or moving forward? Seem to be a good attendance at Appleby Agricultural Show even though the only livestock was horses and poultry. I spoke to David Maclean our MP at the show, he still lamenting the Government's inadequate handling of the crisis last year.

Week 29
Shop fairly bust this week, more family visitors visiting the area, better weather also!! On our day off we went to Carlisle for a tour around the old Crown Court, very interesting, also to the art exhibition at Tullie House called Love Labour Lost. This will also be shown in Exeter, the other greatly affected area for FMD. The exhibition was rural painting depicting British livestock over the last 300 years and it was mounted in the wake of FMD. The exhibition has been well reviewed in the National press. I found it very interesting and stimulating, there was also a small exhibition nearby of local artists, more of them were of the abstract type and featured FMD connections. I suppose in years to come pictorial evidence of the outbreak could be quite valuable, although of course there is the TV footage and press pictures. These days amongst our customers there is very little mention of FMD now. Regarding the Tullie House exhibition the Damien Hurst exhibit of the calf sawn in half preserved in formaldehyde was not pleasing in my opinion, not art.

Week 30
Best trade for a Sunday this week for some time. Generally keeping up to previous years trading pre-FMD. Lovely day out on Tuesday, our day off, we went to Buttermere and walked around the lake. The whole week in the shop has been busy, especially Friday with visitors pre-holiday weekend. Much stock to unpack pre our holiday next Saturday. Just heard today that the café next door is closing from next Saturday – I hope it’s not correct as we don’t need any more empty shops, especially next door! In the throws of becoming a Ltd Company which should reduce our income tax considerably since the chancellor announced that the first £20,000 of a small Ltd. Co. is tax free! Sounded too good to be true but our accountant confirmed this. Traders from the indoor market on Fridays (and sometimes Saturdays) says that trade just hasn’t picked up since last year.

Week 31
Last week of summer hols, busy with visitors. Bank holiday busy in Appleby with the trotting races (2 were cancelled this year because of wet weather and all last years because of FMD). Busy restocking in preparation for our holiday. Visit to Border Fine Arts to discuss future plans for their marketing. Very pleases with the holiday trading this year, hope the Autumn and Christmas is as good as last year. Have just heard the café next door is to close – the owners have been here for 5 years, but never really enjoyed it as they were farmers. Hopefully it won’t be another empty premises, I think their trade has diminished – not so many coaches these days, which the café’s depend upon.

Week 32
On holiday cruise through the Mediterranean, calling at Lisbon then onto Istanbul. Really enjoying the sun and the lectures and entertainment on board. Trying not to read the on board newspaper but just read small article about Snowie Transport that each of the 4 Directors have netted £815,000 each out of FMD transport, the company receiving £42 million in total! Were they related to Nick Brown or Gordon Brown or neither?

Week 33
Still on cruise calling at Yatta, Odessa in the Black Sea. Both very interesting places if not a little sad due to neglect of buildings and infrastructure. Met two families from Devon who didn’t get FMD but were surrounded, and as up here, suffered due to not being able to sell or move stock. They are going on the Countryside March in London, another small article in the ships paper regarding FMD and the fact that the EU will insist on vaccination in future and that no compensation will be forth coming if not complied with. Also seems as though the Blair Government didn’t handle the crisis well enough! Had an interesting discussion with the Devon farmers about the state of agriculture, they were very depressed about it all.

Week 34
Bake from holiday this week very busy preparing to trade as a Ltd company to take advantage of tax concessions for small businesses announced in the budget. Cumbria FMD inquiry report out – nothing we didn’t suspect really, ‘confusion disorder and delay’ were the local newspaper headlines. However, Cumbria County Council seemed determined to do their best to encourage the Government to take heed of the conclusions of the inquiry for the way ahead. The inquiry highlighted the effect felt by the non-farming sector. Our business really was most fortunate in the end not to have been affected but as remarked before, much of the money earned from working for DEFRA I think found it’s way back into the Cumbrian economy at Christmas and in the New Year. I note that they think that there should be further work into the emotional, social and mental health consequences of the FMD in Cumbria (they obviously listened to the report from Lancaster University!).


Week 35
Busy this week with stock valuation re Ltd. Company.  Interested to read our local Herald that Dr Mark Levine from Lancaster University is doing research into causes of night-time violence in Cumbria.  It would seem to me to be fairly obvious that the main cause would be drink coupled with drugs?!!

Rather stressful few days trying to get everything organised OK for change over.

Week 36
No longer open on Sundays.  Out this Sunday to Borrowdale, a wonderful day driving there along Derwentwater could have been in the Italian Lakes!!  What incredible weather we are having.  Shop still quite busy.  The previous 12 months trade will be the best we’ve had since we started 15 years ago - can it last?  Orders for Christmas are coming in nicely, although the last 2 weeks trading pre-Christmas will decide the overall picture for the Christmas period.

Have been rather irritated by inefficiency of bank and credit card companies in getting the new accounts set up for the Ltd. Co. still not completely right yet! 

Week 37
Wonderful weather still.  Taken Jubilee bunting down in town at last.  Have now got to organise the sorting of the light bulbs in the Christmas lights in town!  Being bothered with junk faxes and e-mails - new technology!!!  Have registered to try to stop them.  Busy getting Christmas cards out in shop.  Trouble with shoulder - osteopath on Wednesday - hopefully will ease it.  Local sheep sales seem to be giving good prices for farmers.

Week 38
Interesting talk at Rotary by the Samaritans - highlighted the number of calls from the farming community - among other things.  Foot and Mouth no longer comes up in conversation in the shop - hasn’t for some time.  Now it seems to be the stock market low and return or lack of it, or investments, and the possibility of war.  It makes me shudder!  The thought of yet more innocent people being killed and not the perpetrators of the crimes and leaders of the regimes.  I must admit to having “burying my head in the sand” to remain in equilibrium and not worry.

Week 39
Another interesting Rotary talk by the M.D. of the Auctioneers based in Carlisle.  He highlighted the enormous effect of the shut down for nearly a year due to F&M.  Gradually getting back to some normality, but still suffering through low throughput of livestock in the market due to lower supply of animals in the country together with the 20 day rule for movement.  Getting the Christmas stock into the shop.  People starting to buy presents!!!  Trade still very good.  Busy getting all the paperwork finished to submit to accountant for winding up the partnership.

Week 40
Communication this week from Business Link regarding the IT and marketing monies that we received re F&M.  Recovery, filling in information re financial situation of business lost F&M to evaluate if payments had helped.  Positive reply!!  Another letter stating that we received £8,000 and saying that under EC Special rules, a SME could receive a maximum of £60,000 in a three year period if I understood correctly.  

Had one or two substantial sales of Border Fine Arts pieces this week, could it be F&M money still, they were to farmers.  Interesting reports of a local swaledale (sheep) farm fetching £101,000 more to it than meets the eye perhaps!!  People reserving items for Christmas collection at quite good rate.  It will be very interesting to see if the Christmas trade is anywhere as good as last years, which was exceptional.  

Week 41
By this time last year our monthly trading figures were far higher than previous years, having recovered from the earlier month.  This years figures for October and November are very encouraging up on last years at the moment, can we sustain I wonder?!  

Several customers from farming, seem to be pleased with the level of livestock prices.

My wife attended a meeting where Ann Hopper of Radio Cumbria was speaking, interestingly, she made no mention of her role in the F&M coverage nor were there any questions.  G would have liked to have asked some question - but she didn’t either, seeing as Ann Hopper hadn’t mentioned it!

Week 42
F&M in the news again with DEFRA not wanting to pay up all the contracting money that it owes to various people, disputing the rates they agreed.  Seems that everyone is discussing the Paul Burrell trial and its collapse!!  What a scary state of affairs it all is.  The Monarchy certainly doesn’t seem to come out of it at all well.  

Shop a bit slack this week but a few very good sales anyway.  Trying to work up enthusiasm to get the town Christmas lights organised - always difficult to get peoples help.  

Difficulties with my brother yet again re his depression etc. 



Week 43
Rather slack in the shop this week.  Interesting article in the Cumberland News where a farming family have used £6,000 from the Marketing grant to set up an internet site which has proved very successful to sell their wooden products that now constitute a new part of their business.  

Rather nice story of good coming out of F&M.  A friend whose wife died at the young age of 40 about six years ago rented his cottage to a family during the crisis because he lived in the town and his sister who’s cottage they should have stayed in lived on a farm.  The divorced mother of the family was a long standing friend of the sister and my friend knew her thirty years ago.  They seem to have become very close and as my friend was very distressed for some 4/5 years over his wife’s death its really good to see him happy again.  The only trouble is that they live 300 miles apart.

Week 44
Shop trade similar to last years still.  I have my doubts about sales being as good as last Christmas though.  Interesting snippet on Borders TV re the gene bank for Herdwick sheep - but didn’t catch it all.

Week 45
Difficulties with my brother down south again - don’t think it will ever resolve itself - a terrible illness this true depression.  We can only support him to a certain level.  

Our friends with the Guest House who suffered last year, are on holiday in Jamaica - hope the sunshine will perk up the husband who has been suffering with depression of sorts.  Still not sure if it’s a direct result of F&M.

Week 46
Shop increasingly busy. Getting Christmas cards from friends in South.  Many enquiring about how things are post F&M.  One particular local shop feels that not so much money around this year as there was last.  At the present time we cannot say as we are more or less similar to last year, but the last two weeks can make all the difference both ways!  Generally F&M is no longer mentioned.  Famous last words!!  Farmers wife in today with 3 children 11-22, all showing signs of difficulties of withdrawal and lack of confidence since April.  They got F&M and all 3 youngsters are having counselling and are on medication.

Week 47
Christmas trade slightly below last year to date, but the last few days can make all the difference! It’s interesting how one gets a buzz from a busy day in the shop, selling items across the range from what we stock. It makes us feel that we must be getting much of the buying right!

Week 48
Yet another report on FMD. The European report seems to say there was a lot wrong with how our Government handled the crisis, but of course Dr King only comments on the positive side of the findings.

Week 49
Christmas sales have now exceeded last years! I can never tell until we close the door on Christmas Eve. We are really pleased, especially as at this time of year most buyers are local. We other free gift wrapping if required and the men especially are always pleased! Many women are too! The shop is looking quite empty. We had Christmas dinner out at a local hotel so really enjoyed the two day break.

Week 50 11/01/03
Could get really depressed about Iraq war possibility. Possible lots of innocent lives as always in these situations, but choose to try and not think about it. Rather worrying also in the pension/investments situation, no light at the end of the tunnel yet, but so far the last years figures so we are very fortunate. We are in a strong position is there is a turn down.

Week 51 18/01/03
Can it really be two years since FMD started. Horrible how quickly time goes. With regard to the ‘art and recording public events’ article, I did see the Tullie House exhibition and commented on it in my diary entry. It wasn’t only FMD of course, but I think I found the 2 or 3 paintings concerning FMD to be acceptable at the time. I think as time goes by various paintings I thought not acceptable at the time could become acceptable as an interesting visual record - we do of course also have photographs. We are busy restocking the shop and I look forward to getting some completely new lines - every year it becomes more difficult to find them though.

Week 52
It’s surprising how FMD occasionally keeps cropping up. We had a rotary planning meeting for our annual fun run, which of course didn’t happen in 2001, and I came across letters giving guidelines as to whether or not we could hold it.

Week 57 28/02/03
New gift shop opening in Appleby this week, it hopefully won’t affect us as they intend to stock mainly ‘modern goods’. Also another empty store going to be a delicatessen and the empty Indian restaurant turning into a Chinese, so it’s all good for the town. A massage and beauty shop is also opening so things are looking up, perhaps as far as town shops are concerned.

Week 63 12/04/03
We’ve had a few days in Dumfries and Galloway. I was amazed at the number of large dairy herds grazing. Outside one farm was a large granite block with the name of the pedigree Holstein herd that had obviously been culled and it was dated April 2001 and the inscription read ‘Just gone to grass’. Quite a chilling reminder of what had happened and an indication of perhaps how this farmer dealt with his loss.

Week 65
Heard this week that the Great Orton site is to become a nature reserve and that a memorial stone will be placed there giving information about the burials re FMD. A very good use of the site and I hope that eventually farmers who lost their animals may feel that once it is established they are able to visit. I visited the site some months after FMD burials had finished and I found the desolation of the bare earth disturbing and upsetting, but perhaps once it becomes covered in trees and vegetation once will loose that feeling. My wife has written to the PM re the SARS outbreak reminding him of the chaos in Cumbria regarding FMD and suggesting he doe not let a similar thing happen how!!

Week 66 03/05/03
Interesting to see some of the recommendations put before parliament by DEFRA in the event of a FMD outbreak. The main headline in our local paper was those footpaths were to be kept open except in exceptional circumstances, although if you read on there will be many situations when they would be closed. It also says that protective vaccinations would be considered in certain circumstances – hedging their bets again!! Incineration said to be the main way at dealing with slaughtered animals but not mass pyres! What sort of incineration I wonder. It all seemed a bit woolly to me, but I haven’t read the whole report!

Week 67
We’ve has two customers this week asking if we are recovering after the FMD – interesting that it should be in their mind after 2 years, they were visitors. Our daughters off with work related stress is now improving and hopefully will be back to work when the hospital has relocated her to another dept. Have just heard that our best friend of some 40 years standing, is also off work with work related stress, she works with social services. It seems symptomatic of life today that so many people suffer work related stress.

Week 68
We were not able to get to Great Orton after all. Saw the report on Border TV at the Watchtree nature reserve, were surprised that there were so few people there. The group meeting at the George was interesting, although I think I understood the summary of the 4 categories that the information had been broken down into in the written form better than the chart! However on further study I think that the chart gives a greater knowledge of the complexities of each area as far as I can see everything is covered! I am full of admiration for the way all the information has been interpreted. It was interesting to see that the vet at our group meeting still gets emotionally affected when debating the condition over FMD.

Week 69
Attended a Cumbria Community Foundation promotional evening at Davenby Hall Cockermouth, where the Ford Rally cars are prepared. The event was to get business to be a corporate member. There is a balance sheet for the Cumbria Community Recovery Fund re FMD, £2.1 million raised and all of it has been distributed. 685 grants of around £1000 to farm-related businesses, 392 to non-farm related, 131 to community groups, 182 to special projects, £50,000 to projects relating to long-term health impacts. 93% of individual businesses supported have survived, 99% of community groups supported have achieved their objectives. I was very sceptical about this fund at the time, but it would seem to have done a great deal of good.

Week 70
Young student from Lancaster University doing a reasonably in-depth survey of the forthcoming horse fair, quite a task for her alone! Trying to find out for the town council/chamber of trade and fair committee more accurate details of those attending, benefit or not to the town trade, inconvenience and difficulties experienced all round. Traffic problems etc. Not sure whether she will end up with anything meaningful! But it will be interesting.

Week 71
Now into the Horse Fair very, very busy time. Weather ok this year, apart from the Sunday. No problems with visitors! Good to see many yearly friends and customers, but sad that several of the old people have died since last year. The next generation have obviously on to living in houses. I don’t have the same outlook.

Week 72
I think this is the last diary? I have found the experience of keeping the diary quite interesting, but generally have found I have had to really search for FMD related topics. I have really enjoyed the interchange of information with I and I generally found our talks stimulating. It’s also been interesting to be part of an extensive survey (the first time) and see how the information is correlated. I’m sure it will be very interesting to attend the conference and see all the ends tied together! Good luck to you all.

Week 1
Thurs: Phone call from DEFRA regarding damage to buildings
Fri: visit from DEFRA to cost the damage
Christmas week but nobody seems to be in festive mood. [son] spent Christmas Day with girlfriend’s family, (daughter) was working in local hotel, [other son] gave Christmas day a miss this year. [wife] and I decided to go out for Christmas dinner.
We still have no breeding ewes on the farm yet, which is quite worrying as we have quota for 900 and the retention period is only 6 weeks away.
 We had a visit from DEFRA on Friday. We had a lot of damage done to walls, gates etc when the slaughtered animals were being loaded into lorries. DEFRA seems to question the cost of everything. Back in march they told us what had to be done and they would pay for it, but now they don’t seem to be so keen. We are sick of hearing from them, and wish the FMD saga was ended.. 

Week 2
The week began with the news that more sheep have been slaughtered in Northumberland. We were going to look at some store lambs at Allandale but DEFRA have put movement restrictions on the area so things are at a standstill again. This has been the most depressing thing the last 2 months, trying to get stock back on the farm. We see DEFRA officials on the TV every week. Crowing about how well they have done getting FMD under control. If they had got on with the job last March we wouldn’t be in the state we are today.
We are still no nearer getting any breeding ewes. A friend who buys sheep in the north of Scotland went to look at some for us, but he thought they were too dear. Went to New Year’s party at friend’s house, mainly farmers, the only time FMD was mentioned was at midnight when everybody said good riddance to 2001.




Week 3
Monday: sold first sheep today
Back in business, took the first fat lambs for 10 months to Longtown collection centre. Feel a lot more confident this week. We expect the auction to open in mid-Feb. I don’t like the way we are selling them at the moment as you don’t know how much you are going to get for them, but it is better than nothing.. 
We made a lot of hay last summer and we advertised in the Farmers Guardian. We were surprised at the number of enquiries we had as far away as the midlands. The cash from the hay will be very welcome as we have had no income for 6 months.
A few friends and neighbours I have spoken to have not started to stock up yet and don’t seem to be in any hurry to start again. Some of them seem to have got rid of a lot of debt and don’t want to go up the same road again. When you have no cows to milk or stock to feed, every weekend off for 6 months you soon see how the other half live. 

Week 4
A very sad week, a very close friend died on Thursday. We had known one another for over 30 years. With played golf and darts, and he was very well liked in the local community. He was always optimistic about farming after the F&M.
We are still trying to get some breeding ewes, but it is very difficult as most of them are a long way off. You feel very frustrated if you travel hundreds of miles and the sheep are not of the standard you expected, and you return home empty-handed. All restrictions have been lifted in the UK this week so we expect things will be getting back to normal now. It doesn't seem 11 months ago since F&M started. Hopefully all the disasters are behind us now and we can expect a better future.

Week 5
We had 250 in-lamb ewes delivered this week. The farm is now functioning the more like pre F& M days now. DEFRA have started to lift restrictions, but having to get movement licences is still a bit of a drag. Met a lot of friends this week at a friend's funeral. Had not seen some of them for over 12 months due to the F&M. It certainly makes a difference to life with all auctions closed and social events cancelled. Some of them told me they had not left their farms for over six months. A few still had no stock and weren’t going to stock up, until the spring. One friend who milked about 200 cows thought there was no incentive to start again. It had taken him six months to get over the slaughtering of his cows. The herd had been started by his grandfather over 60 years ago. Listening to farmers some have taken it very badly others just think it's a disaster waiting to happen, but there is one thing, things will never be the same again.

Week 6
The long awaited Curry report was published this week. Farming is unsustainable in its present form according to the report. It must be music to the ears for Mrs Beckett and her team at DEFRA. They insist subsidies must be phased out, and farms should have less stock. I think it is a good idea, but food prices will have to rise, and will the public pay for it. (?) Nothing was mentioned about illegally imported meat. If this was the cause of the outbreak last year you would have thought it would be the first thing it would have done. I don't think these proposals will come to anything as the rest of the farmers in Europe won’t wear them.
We got some more breeding sheep out of Scotland this week. We have now about 50 per cent of the number we had last year. Things are slowly getting back to normal but you keep thinking what surprises are around the corner.

Week 7
As we are into Feb now I start to think what happened a year ago more often. I sometimes wonder, did it really happen or was it just a bad dream. This time last year we were preparing for lambing, getting sheds ready etc to bring ewes inside then disaster struck, the foot and mouth outbreak. I can’t say I’m looking forward to this year's lambing after what happened last year even though we have only half as many ewes. I don't think anybody else is round about either. The local auctions are hoping to get restarted in the next two or three weeks. But I believe DEFRA are giving them a lot of hassle. I think DEFRA would have liked to have seen them shut down for good. We have been taking cattle and sheep to the collection centres but you are never sure how much you are going to get until a week later when the money comes in the post. The 20 day standstill is the biggest hurdle for us. The only way we can get round it is by sending cattle and sheep the straight to slaughter. 


Week 8
Things are slowly getting back to normal. We have been able to sell more stock this last week or two. But as the auctions are open next week, the 20 day standstill is going to be a major headache. DEFRA wants to keep the stranglehold on all movements of stock, it makes your blood boil when you can't get stock on and off the farm.
Talked to one or two neighbours this week who are just about to start and stock up again. None of them seemed to be too confident about the future. They think the government has got us where they want us and they are not going to let go. The government wants farmers to diversify, but we can't all go into B&B and the like. Most farmers’ wives in this area have part-time jobs, and there is very little hired labour on the farms. Most farmers’ sons have part-time jobs in auctions etc. The local small businesses round here have really had a bad time since the F&M. They rightly think they have been forgotten about. Country people have come to the conclusion that they have to keep the countryside spick and span for the townspeople to enjoy on a Sunday

Week 9
This time last year the nightmare had begun. Everything was at a complete standstill, you could not even move stock across the road. We were just preparing to start lambing and had 800 ewes stuck in fields and could not get them inside. We spoke to our vet to see if we could get MAFF to allow us to fetch them in, but he said it would be a waste of time asking, as they had told him Longtown market were up to their eyes in it. To make matters worse we had a blizzard and had about a foot of snow on the ground. It was certainly the worst week of my farming life. You could hardy believe that a pig found with F&M in an Essex slaughterhouse could cause chaos across the country in a matter of days. People around here have started talking about it again and wonder if it is completely gone yet. There have been some sheep found with antibodies in the Kirkby Stephen area this week, hopefully it is just a blip in the restocking procedure. Hopefully over the next few months farming will get back to what it was pre F&M and we can start to forget about this last 12 months

Week 10
Thoughts keep going back to this time last year. F&M broke out round Longtown this week last year. Everybody was stunned, wondering were it was going to happen next. As we now know we were slaughtered out the next week. Funny thing is nobody mentions much about it , but you know everybody is thinking about it. After a year we hope things will get back to normal, but with all the restrictions and movement standstills DEFRA doesn’t seem to want to get back top normal again. The local auctions are having difficulty getting back to pre-F&M. The supermarkets would rather by-pass the auctions and source the stock straight from the farms. The first live sales in England have started, but there isn’t much stock being sold. The twenty day standstill has kept the numbers down. We have been sending our sheep and cattle to the collection centres as it is the only way to get round the 20 day standstill. I think we are going to have to put up with a lot more red tape and restrictions. I think farmers are going to have to struggle on as we have for the last few years. It makes you wonder if it is all worth it.

Week 11
It is now a year ago this week that we had F&M. Every day your thoughts go back to the same day last year remembering what we were doing. Sometimes meet friends and neighbours to speak to and they all say it’s different to this time last year. There is still one or two have not started back in farming yet. They just don’t seem to have the stomach to restart yet. Any stock that is getting sold at the minute seems to be very expensive, so it is not easy for them to start back yet. We have been buying and selling quite a lot of stock lately, and it is good to get back into the swing of things. Once spring gets here and the fields are full of stock once again, we will be able to put the disasters of last year behind us. I think most farmers are more worried what the government are going to do in the next few months more than anything else. They don’t seem to have taken much interest in Cumbria these last few months. At least the Prince of Wales has.

Week 12
Everybody feeling a lot better this week now that the first week of March has passed and the memory of last year can be put in the past. I think if we could trade livestock without the need of licenses etc the memory would fade faster. The government seems to hope that live auctions for stock will end if they keep restrictions on them for the next few months. The government says that the country is clear of F&M, so why are all these restrictions still in operation. A lot of farmers sons work in auctions part time, and they are all out of a job at the moment and are finding it very tough to earn a living. The government don’t seem to realise what kind of affect they are having on country life. The small businesses are still having a tough time of it and they think they will never see the good times again.

Week 13
There has been a lot of talk about inquiries this last few weeks but the government does not seem to want to know. I think if we don’t have a full public inquiry we will never know the full facts. The way the government is acting they would rather sweep it under the carpet and forget about it. I think there will be very few people that will know where F&M came from and they will be in the heart of the government. Nothing seems to be being done about all the illegal meat that is coming into the country. We are preparing to start lambing in the next week or so, so we will be quite busy and will not have time to think about what happened last year. The weather could do us a big favour if it would dry up and had some nice sunshine

Week 14
After a very wet weekend, the sun has shone for most of the week. It does make lambing a lot easier when it is warm and there is plenty of sun. We have a lot more cattle now so there is no room inside for the ewes. It is the first time that we have lambed outside for about thirty years. A good lambing would certainly compensate for last years disaster. Lambing ewes are very scarce in Cumbria as you can’t get a pet lamb for love nor money. We are still having difficulty in getting stock sold. This 20 day standstill will have a disastrous effect on farming if the govt doesn’t do something about it. I thought the country was free from F&M? Press is full of the meeting between DEFRA, Blair, NFU about the future of farming. The government want to get rid of subsidies, but as long as we are tied to the EEC I don’t think they have a hope in hell. It was always thought that after the F&M shambles the government would put the boot in.

Week 15 
The weather has turned for the better this week. It must have known that we were starting to lamb. It makes things a lot easier when the weather is good as we are lambing outside this year, the first time for over twenty years. We are still having difficulty in marketing our fat lambs and fat cattle due to the twenty day standstill.
Have spoken to one or two farmers who say they have completely ignored it as they reckon they will go out of business if they stick to the rules. DEFRA must know that these restrictions cant last much longer. I suppose it keeps the price of food down, so they will keep them as long as possible


Week 16
(respondent and family busy lambing)
Still good weather for lambing which is going well. We have three hundred blackface ewes first time we have had this breed and we are pleased with them. What a difference to this time last year. Not an animal on the farm and all we were doing was washing out buildings.
Have heard this last week that there is a lot of farmers around Wigton that have not started to re stock yet. It is not surprising as the price of milk is on the way down and store cattle for beef production are very dear. It certainly looks as though there is going to (be) big changes in farming in Cumbria.

Week 17 (lambing)
A surprise knock on the door on Tuesday morning, a lady from DEFRA wondered if it would be possible to count our breeding ewes for the subsidy. After all the talk about bio-security I though they would be the last people to come and wander about among the sheep. I managed to put her off for a couple of days and she came back on Thursday and got the job done. She said she had a few frosty receptions with some farmers and I told her that it didn’t surprise me. Lambing is going really well at the minute with very few problems. Still selling fat cattle and sheep through the collection centres, but have to wait a week to see how much you get for them.

Week 18 (lambing)
The weather turned very wet last weekend and it has been a lot colder for most of the week. Nearly finished lambing now which has been the easiest that I can rem(em)ber. Read in the local paper that the NFU was hoping that some of the restrictions would be lifted in the near future on the store market for breeding sheep. It is about time something was done as there is no pleasure in farming at the moment with all these dos and don’ts. Scotland seems to have got on a lot faster with the post FM restrictions. DEFRA have got the numbers of sheep down in Cumbria, and they are going to try and keep it that way.

Week 19 WB 29/4/02
This is the best lambing weather we have had for years. We are just about finished now, and it is a great relief after the shambles of last year. We are still struggling to get good prices for our feeding hoggs. We have about five hundred still to sell. Still having to sell direct to the abattoirs as we are buying in cattle for fattening and this is the only way round the twenty day standstill rule. I am now convinced the government will not lift it as it will certainly put some of the auction marts out of business and that is what the government wants. There is quite a lot of concern about TB in the area. One or two farmers have stocked up with animals from the south of the country w(h)ere TB is still about.

Week 20
WB 6/5/02
A much quieter week this on the work front. Lambing finished and all the crop in. The weather is still dry but rather cold. Had a day off this week at Kelso races. A local farming society has a bus trip there every year. Met a few farmers who had had F&M and had not got back into action yet. One farmer who had his dairy stock slaughtered said he hadn’t got over it yet. He had spent 25 years building up his herd and was devastated when they were slaughtered. I think those with cows have took it very badly. Scotland seems to be getting back to normal a lot quicker than this side of the border.
They have had a few shows already with cattle and sheep. This side of the border they are having shows without any livestock, thanks to DEFRA

WEEK  22    
Animal health officer from DEFRA called regarding the TB testing. After she looked at all the movements and where our stock came from, she thought it would be unlikely that we would be to test. Most of our cattle are here for fattening, they are most worried about breeding stock, what a relief.
The local public enquiry has been doing the rounds lately. I haven’t been to any of them but I believe a few of the speakers have had horror stories to tell. I don’t think these meetings will do a lot of good, as the government just wants to forget the whole thing. Was at a farm sale at the weekend, the farmers was wiped out with F&M so he thought it was a good time to pack in farming.

WEEK  23     WB 27/5/02 |
Store sheep sales started this week in Longtown Auction. There was quite a lot of interest but not much action. Numbers were very low, when it is usually one of the busiest times for selling ewes and lambs. It seems a lot of farmers don’t want to get tied into this twenty day standstill and are not bothering to buy any. The restrictions that DEFRA are putting on farmers now are strangling the industry. The news that Bobby Waugh was found guilty wasn’t a big surprise. I think the state veteniary service was just as guilty as they had inspected his farm just weeks before the outbreak of F&M

WEEK  24  Week begin 3/6/02    
The weather has been a bit better this week, a few local farmers have started to silage. There seems to be abundance of grass this year. I suppose the reason being is that there is very few sheep around. The local village hall had a Jubilee fun night at the weekend. It is the first real “Do” that we have had in the hall since the start of FM. There was a big turn-out from all walks of life. It is good to see the countryside pulling together, as the national government seems to have washed their hands on us. I got quite a shock at the number of strangers that turned up at the “do”. It seems that the countryside is getting overrun with townspeople. I am not against them but some of them try to take everything over, and they don’t know how the countryside works.

WEEK  25  Week begin 10/6/02    
|
This week the weather turned for the worse. Most of the cows in the district are back indoors, and silage making has come to a standstill. Farming can ill afford bad weather at this time of year when prices are so low. We have just about got all the fat hoggets sold. The price has risen the last few weeks, there isn’t a lot of spring lambs about yet. There isn’t a lot of pleasure selling stock at the moment, you just send them away and hope that you get a good price for them. I have only been at one auction since they opened up again, I just have no interest going when you can’t wander through the pens without dressing up with oilskins on. Farming at the minute is like living in a police state. They are doing their best to put the auction marts out of business.

WEEK  26  
   WB 17/602
The big talking point this week is the weather. The land is a complete bog. silaging and land work is at a complete standstill. We still have our sheep to clip, I can never remember clipping after the middle of June. The bad weather is the last thing we want after the disaster of last year. Most farmers I speak to wonder why we struggle on. Saw the minister speaking on TV about changing the CAP she says the government will go it alone and phase out subsidies. I think food prices would have to rise 30%. Most farmers think the public have had a good deal out of the CAP. The government seems to think farmers would be better off without subsidies but I can’t see it, the way they let other countries dump cheap food on us.

WEEK  28  
July
The local press this weekend is full of stories about Dr Peter Tiplady admitting that the public were at risk from the burning of animals during the F & M epidemic. Well I heard him say that there was no danger to health at a public meeting in April 2001 there was two or three experts in the audience, and they blew him to bits. It is amazing that somebody in such a senior position, can admit a year after that he didn't believe what he was saying. It is obvious that he was told what to say by MAFF.
The weather gets no better, we still haven't got the sheep clipped or any hay made. A lot of farmers around here are getting quite desperate as most of the cows are still in and they haven't got any silage yet.

WEEK  29  
July
The weather is making everybody very depressed. After last year's disaster of this is the last thing we wanted. I've spoken to a few farmers, who have told me that they wished they hadn't restocked now. Some farmers have all their stock back indoors, and they are trying to buy hay and silage to feed them. Our next-door neighbour has been trying to make silage for over a month now. I have been on the phone to sheep clippers but they have no idea when they will get to our place. Over the last five or six years, it's just seems to be one disaster after another. It was good to hear Prince Charles speaking up for the farmers at the Royal show. He seems to have more idea about the problems of the countryside than the government.

WEEK  30

July a slight improvement in the weather this week. Have been trying to get the sheep clippers to come but they say that they are that far behind that it will be at least another week before they will be here. We decided to cut all the hay and hope that we would get a good week to get it.
DEFRA are refusing to lift the twenty day standstill will rule. It is going to cause a lot of problems in a month or two’s time when most of the sales take place before winter.

WEEK  31  
July
A much better week, we got the sheep clipped and the hay baled. What a difference a few sunny days make. We are just a few days from starting to cut barley and the rain has started to fall again. Back to square one.
Everybody is up in arms about this 20 day rule not being lifted. The country is free from F&M so the government could drop it to six days and it would still have plenty of control of animals. Talking to an auctioneer the other day he reckons if it isn’t relaxed this autumn the auctions might as well close, because most of them are losing money anyway. We are still sending our cattle and sheep direct, but the prices we receive are a long way short of what they should be.

Week 32
  
The big news this week is the announcement of the closure of Penrith market. It is quite obvious that all the auction marts in Cumbria must be under severe pressure after the F and M  disaster. The only people who will be pleased hear this news will be the top brass at DEFRA. They have made no secret that they would like to see all the auctions closed. Well if this happens, then it will be goodbye to a lot of farmers. We've been selling prime stock direct to the abattoirs and all I can say that it is the road to nowhere. The weather doesn't get any better. Some farmers up the country are in dire straits. Most of them have neither hay or silage. With most of the stock indoors it must be costing them a fortune for feed. 

Week 33
Started harvest this week, but it has been a stop - go job. The biggest job is getting the combine to travel as the ground is absolutely bottomless. And have never seen the land as wet since 1985. I have spoken to a few farmers further up the country and they’re on the verge of giving up. They can hardly believe after the disaster of F and M last year it would be followed by this weather this year. This seems to be a lot of angry farmers around Penrith, the way the closure of the market was announced. I think they should have called a meeting with the farmers first and explained the difficulties they were in.

Week 34
The government is not prepared to move very much on the 20 day rule. I can't understand what it is in aid of. The country has been clear F&M for months now. Why can't it be reduced to six days, and all bought-in stock keeped on their own? I don't how some farmers will cope as autumn is the peak period for trading. The weather doesn't get much better, harvest is very slow, and the barley is getting blacker by the day. We are fairly lucky as one near neighbour has not got his first cut silage yet. His cows have been inside for most of the summer and he has been buying in fodder for them for the last two months, he reckons he could be out of business by November. 

Week 35
Finished cutting barley this week although most of the straw is still lying in the fields. The ground is that wet that it is doubtful whether we will never get it. Most farmers further up the country are still struggling to make hay and silage. Most of them think that if they don't get it by the end of August they will never get any. The only bright spot in farming at the minute is the price of lambs. The buyers reckon that they are very scarce this year. It is little wonder the number of breeding sheep that was culled in 2001. Long keep lambs in the north of Scotland are up by about £10 on the year. A lot of farmers in this area said that they wouldn't go back into sheep, but I think they will be the most profitable enterprise there is.

Week 36
The weather is still the big problem this week. We get about 4 dry days then the heavens open. We are still waiting to start the spring barley but the ground is that wet, I don't think the combine would travel. We have very little to complain about, as there are a lot of farmers still struggling to get hay and silage. It has been an uphill struggle to get stock sold lately with the 20th day standstill in operation we have been taking stock to Wigton and Carlisle as they have dedicated markets, which means that you have to sell them and can't take them home if they make a poor price. I don't know how much longer these restrictions are going to last, but we are getting sick and tired of it all. I thought we lived in a free country?

Week 37
Started cutting spring barley this week, but got only half a day at it before the rain came down. The weather this year is causing just about as much heartache as the F and M did last year.  The good news this week is that Longtown auction is starting a dedicated auction once a fortnight. You don't come under the 20 day restrictions as long as you sell the animals. DEFRA have relaxed some of the rules concerning sheep movements, but most farmers think it is a complete farce the way they are going about it. The ministry vets seem to be giving advice that covers themselves without thinking about the farmers.

Week 38
Finished cutting barley this week. The weather has improved a lot, but the ground is still very wet. The yields are very poor this year, there has been too much rain and not enough sunshine. We will have to buy a lot of barley this year so it will not help the bank balance. I read that DEFRA are starting a buy-up scheme for sheep quota. They certainly don't want anybody keeping sheep after F and M. I don't think it will be very successful as sheep are just about the most profitable enterprise at the moment. DEFRA have sent out new forms to fill in when selling sheep. It must be costing the country a fortune in red tape

Week 39
I have just watched Countryfile on the TV. The whole program about illegal meat coming into the country. I think it is a disgrace that very little is being done about it, while we are hassled with forms to fill in, trailers to wash and disinfect. Lord Whitty says there is warning signs up at all airports, but nobody knows where they are. He looked a complete fool trying to make excuses about the whole affair. The experts reckon it is just a matter of time before there is another outbreak F and M or something else if nothing is done to stop it

Week 40
Summer has arrived at last. The last week has been the best weather of the summer. Most farmers' round about seem to be trying to get some dry silage. It will be wanted as they have been using most of the stuff they got earlier in the summer. The back-end stock sales are in full swing now. A lot different to last year when everything was at a standstill. Stock seems to be a very good trade, with sheep making a big comeback. Most farmers selling in the store rings are not pleased about the 20 day standstill. I'd think it is a disaster for the ones who buy and sell most weeks. The only way to get round it is to have two holding numbers, if you are lucky.

Week 41
Summer is still with us, it is getting warmer  if anything. Have been helping neighbour to get some late second cut silage. The quality is not too bad but the ground is still very wet in places. We have been selling quite a few cattle and sheep lately. We have to sell in dedicated auctions so that we don't fall into the 20 day movement ban. Sheep prices are holding up well, and there seems to be large numbers getting sold at Longtown. You would wonder where they were all coming from after last year's clean out. I see DEFRA are bringing in a buy-up scheme for sheep quota but the price doesn't seem to be very exciting

Week 42 
The weather is still a great and a lot of farmers are still busy getting some late silage. We have been busy putting winter barley in, we hope it will yield a lot better than last year. Have been reading the report on FMD about Cumbria. Not many surprises in it, but it pointed out how slow DEFRA was in getting things moving. They were obviously very short in manpower. We have a farm close by that has not stocked up yet he usually feeds about 300 cattle but the prices he's going to have to pay for them he doesn't think he can make any money at it.

Week 43
Much colder this week and the rain came this weekend, it never stopped for 24 hours. We've been buying tups this week, they are in very short supply this year, and are very expensive. We are up to 500 ewes this year, but we have a quota for over 900, so we have a long way to go to get up to that number. The 20 day standstill rule is still giving problems. We have a few cows and calves to sell, but we are buying in calves most weeks, so that's going to come to a standstill. The government are going to have to remove it before long, or most farmers will just ignore it. Even the local vets think it’s a stupid rule.

Week 44
After a wet weekend and weather turned back to summer this week. Although we have had some frosty nights. We have been buying tups this week. There is certainly a shortage of tups the prices they are making. And every farmer seems to be wanting them. We have just got back to about half our usual ewe numbers. We have quota for over 900 but the prices breeding sheep are making, I don't think we will get anywhere near that figure. We have a lot more cattle now so the sheep will have to take a back seat.

Week 45
The weather took a turn for the worse this weekend. Sunday night was very wet and cold, it seems to have turned from heatwave to winter in a matter of days. I just hope it isn't going to rain for the rest of the winter like last year. We have been doing a lot of work among the sheep these last few days. There seems to be a lot of lameness among them. The vet reckons these things happen when you start a new herd or flock. It seems the F and M outbreak is going to cause problems long after it is gone.

Week 46
We have started one of these 20 day standstills this week. We are selling a heifer and calf at Carlisle in two weeks' time so we can't buy anything in until after that. It is the first time we have been on one, and I wouldn't like it to happen too often. I can see why those farmers who buy and sell in the store markets are up in arms about it. There is a lot of talk of some farmers sticking two fingers up at it as they can't run their businesses. I think a complete standstill of all livestock would be enough if F and M did raise its ugly head again. In the meantime all the forms that is to fill in to move stock should be enough.

Week 47
Putting tups out with the ewes this week. The ground is very wet again and moving sheep around it is very difficult. We have been selling quite a few bulls these last few weeks, but prices have been very poor. With the country only 60% self-sufficient in beef you would think it would push the prices up. It seems they can import a lot cheaper. I think it will take a year or two before we can export enough to alter the price. We seem to be the dumping ground for the rest of the world.

Week 48
It is a year ago this week but we started to restock after the F and M disaster. Time fairly flies by, it is nearly two years since the epidemic started. We have a lot more stock now than we had before, which is a bit surprising as the government were hell-bent on cutting stock numbers. I don't think anybody want to go back to the numbers they had before. But to make a half-decent living you have to have the numbers. Sheep prices are a lot better this year, but the beef job isn't too hot. With the country 40% short in beef meat you would think the prices would be a lot better. It must be cheaper for the meat trade to import it.

Week 49
the farming press this weekend that 15,000 people have left the farming industry the since F and M. It is hardly a surprise as the dire state farming is in. What is worse there is a lot less young people coming into the industry. We have a lot of neighbours who have young sons, who are not interested in working seven days a week for peanuts. A lot of older farmers got their eyes opened when they had no stock to look after, and not much else to do, and some of them have not restocked yet.

Week 50
Very busy week this as [other son] went off to Smithfield Show. Most farmers round here had one of the family away. I suppose with the show every other year now and the F and M last year, it was a good excuse to have a blow-out. He must have had a good time as he came home skint. The weather doesn't get any better, the ground is very wet. We still have about 50 cattle outside and they are making a right plough up. We are starting to sell more cattle at the moment, so we might get them inside one of these days.

Week 51
Had a chat with a friend the other day who had just come back from Canada. He reckons the Government hasn't done much to stop illegal food from coming into the country. When they landed in Canada they had to declare all foodstuffs, even fruit, sniffer dogs were used around their luggage and a big fine if they broke the rules. When he came back to Manchester he never saw a sign or anything else for fetching in food. It is little wonder that the country gets FMD and other diseases. The weather has turned dry and cold these last few days let's hope it lasts for a few weeks as the land is just like a bog.

Week 52
The weather has been a lot better this week. It makes work a lot easier when you can walk about the fields without going up to the knees in slatter. The 20 day Movement rule is still causing a lot of anger around here. A lot of farmers around here are just ignoring it now. They say if they stick to the rules they can't make a living. We have been stuck with it just once and it certainly made things very difficult. Even the local vets think it is silly. I think a six-day rule would be about right. Sheep prices are back on the rise again. We still want more breeding sheep to fill quota, but they are going to be very expensive to buy.

Week 53 
It is a year ago that I first started writing these diaries, time goes by fast. It is nearly two years since F and M first struck us. Thinking back that long it just seems like a bad dream, all those fires burning, ministry officials running about the country, television crews parked up in every lay-by, things are very quiet now. In Longtown we had government ministers there telling us how they were going to help us get back to normal again, promising the shops financial help. I don't think they have ever seen a penny to this day. We have had numerous inquiries about who was to blame, and what should happen in the future if it ever happens again. I think the Government is letting it die a natural death and in a years' time it will all be forgotten about.

Week 54 (Christmas week)
As it is Christmas week not a lot of work done. Most of the time is taken up feeding stock etc. Prices for prime sheep and cattle seem to have gone up these last few weeks. DEFRA have announced that all sheep have to be individually tagged from the spring. What are they going to think of next? Selling sheep is turning into a nightmare, with all forms that is to fill-in, and now this. Farms that have come onto the market this back end seemed to be making good prices. A lot of outside buyers are coming into the market buying the farmhouse then selling the land off after.

Week 55
Happy New Year everybody let's hope it is better than last year at least the weather. F and M seems to be fading into the distant past, the only thing that reminds me of it is all forms that is to fill-in and the trailers to wash out and disinfect. We could do with better prices for stock, as they are at about the same as they were 10 years ago. Can you buy a new car for the same money as you could 10 years ago? Reports in the farming press say that 15,000 have left the land since F and M. That should tell the government something. Most farmers just plod on thinking something better will turn up.

Week 56
This week has been very cold with hard frosts at night. Most of the days have been taken up with thawing water pipes. The weather seems to go from one extreme to another. This kind of weather is not ideal for cattle most of ours are coughing with runny noses. Cattle and sheep prices have been fairly good this last week for two. Often after Christmas and New Year prices go flat but the end of January could be the big test when credit cards are paid off. The meat trade reckons the country is short of beef and lamb, so let's hope prices are on the up from now on

Week 57
The farming press this weekend thinks the government will relax the 21 day rule next week. It predicts it will drop it to a six-day standstill. It will be a lot better to work with although I think it should be scrapped altogether. The government can easily bring in an instant ban if F and M broke out again. It is a wonder anybody bothers with sheep the amount of paperwork there is with them. If you want to move them 200 yards on to a neighbour’s field you have three forms to fill in. The red tape involved with farming is getting beyond a joke.

Week 58
Trying to find more ewes for our quota. This year we must have at least 70 % of our quota or DEFRA will cut our quota. After the F and M cull sheep are very scarce in Cumbria and Scotland and very expensive. The local auction are trying to find us some from the north of Scotland but they are very expensive before you get them hauled down here. The price of fat lambs have been very high which is making breeding ewes very expensive. A lot of farmers didn't go back into sheep after the F and M, but a lot of them wish they had now that prices have rocketed.

Week 59
We have been selling a lot of cattle these last few weeks but the trade has been up and down. If one or two buyers don't turn up at the auction you can easily lose two or three hundred pounds on half-a-dozen animals. There seems to be a lot of beef being imported from South America and Ireland at the present time. The supermarkets don't care where they get it from as long as the price is right. Farmers on the Continent would not put up with it, but British farmers just seemed to put up with it. A lot of it is cut up and packed as British beef which can't be right. 

Week 60
Winter has arrived this week. We have had a good six inches of snow this last day also. The stock eat a lot more fodder when the snow lies about for a week we have had a lot of bother with frozen pipes, as there were some very hard frosts. We had 150 ewe lambs delivered from Perthshire this week so we have got up to our 70 per cent of our quota filled. We don't start lambing until April, so we are hoping the weather will be as good as last year. As all the sheds are full of cattle we have to lamb them outside and good weather is half the battle.

Week 61
Reform of the CAP is the big talking point at the moment. If Mrs Beckett gets her way farmers will get a single payment from Europe and will be free to farm any way they like. It will be a good idea if the payment is big enough and the prices don't collapse for meat and cereals. I suppose it will be France and Germany who decides what will happen in the end. The weather has taken a turn for the better this week, and the ground is drying out fast. The winter barley crops are looking really well so let's hope for a good summer.

Week 62
Another dry week but had some very frosty nights. We had to dip about 300 sheep this week as they were showing signs of scab. They were bought in late last year and had obviously not been dipped. Scab is the biggest health problem among sheep now. It spreads very easily through auctions, cattle wagons etc. I think DEFRA should fetch mandatory dipping back again. It is two years since F and M broke out, the time passes very quickly. I don't think about it much now the only when somebody else mentions it.

 


Week 63
The 20 day standstill is reduced to 6 this weekend. It will take a lot of pressure off farmers who buy and sell every week. The auction companies are not very happy with the new arrangements as they are not allowed to keep stock on the premises overnight. It will hit the big pedigree sales etc. The weather is still good and it feels as though spring is just around the corner. It is two years this weekend that we got the F and M. Nobody in house has mentioned it, so it must be fading into the past.

Week 64
The weather is still dry and sunny. Let's hope it lasts until the end of April when we should be well through the lambing. We have been moving the ewes into smaller lots, as we lamb outside now. All the sheds are full of young bulls. We have about 200 bulls at the minute. They don't make a lot when you sell them, but there is quite a bit of subsidy on them so it makes them worth rearing. Fat sheep are getting dearer every week. The F and M cull plus the rise of the Euro are making them more exportable. Reports in the farming press say that spring lambs in France are making between £90 and £100 apiece. I wonder if we will ever see these prices?

Week 65
The week has been warm and sunny through the day, but very cold at nights. With some very sharp frosts. Our fields look like a desert with the grass burnt brown with the frosts. We had a few ewes lambed this week. We didn't expect them this early but the way the weather is they are doing well. A lot of farmers are very concerned about the decoupling of farm subsidies. The government would like to make one single payment, as long as we do as we are told. I think we will be a lot worse off if it comes into operation.

Week 66
The weather is that cold and the ground that dry, we got the contractor in to start and plough. A day later they fetched the drill so we have ploughed and drilled 60 acres of barley in just over two days. It must be 20 years since we had crop sown in March.
The lambing is going very slowly, I suppose the weather is too dry, we just need a good wet night and they will all start and lamb. The main news at the moment is the war in Iraq. I think the people in the US have very short memories, it could turn into another Vietnam.

Week 67
Another dry sunny week, but had some very hard frosts. The spring barley is just showing through, but things could do with a shower of rain just to freshen them up. Cut the lawn the other day, the earliest I can remember. The lambing is going along slowly, but we can't complain as it is the easiest we have ever had. Things are getting a bit hectic in house as our older son [son] gets married on 12th April. The house seems to be full every night with friends and neighbours bringing presents.

Week 68
A very busy week ended with [son]'s wedding on Saturday. It was a long hard day, as we were up at 5am in the morning. Trying to get cattle and sheep fed twice before the wedding at 12:mid-day. There was quite a bit of travelling as the wedding was at Lanercost and a reception at the White Heather Kirkbride. Everybody seemed to enjoy it and the weather made the day. There was no disasters when we got up late on Sunday morning which was a relief as something usually goes wrong when you don't want it to. 

Week 69  
Back to normal this week after the wedding. The weather still as good as ever. In fact it has got very hot this week. Our fields look like deserts, they are in need of a good soaking. I suppose when it starts to rain it will never stop. There is a lot of concern about the mid-term review. Some farmers think they will be left with no subsidies if it goes through as planned. Let's hope that France and Ireland throws it out as their farmers are very much against it.

Week 70
The rains came on Friday and the farm had greened up on Saturday morning. It is a welcome change as the ewes and lambs were needing a lot of feed. Sheep are a tremendous trade at the moment, spring lambs were making over £100 apiece in Longtown on Thursday. We still have 200 fat hoggs to sell, so we are hoping that the trade keeps up. We have been buying black-and-white bull calves since F and M but they are not worth a lot when you come to sell them. If it wasn't for the bull subsidy they wouldn't be worth bothering with.

Week 71  
The rain this last week has changed the colour of the countryside. The grass is growing fast, and barley crops are looking much better. Let's hope it knows when to stop. Most of the ewes have now lambed, but we have about 150 hoggs to lamb, and they have just started, so we could be still on in the middle of June. Sheep are still very dear, not many spring lambs about yet and the rise of the euro is making exporting easier. The mass cull has certainly put a floor on the sheep job, let's hope that we don't see everybody rushing back into sheep.

Week 72
The rain is still coming down, and it is much colder this week. We stopped feeding the ewes and lambs last weekend, and now we are worried that they might take staggers with the cold weather and wet grass. The hoggs have started to lamb but are very slow. I think we could still be lambing well into June. There doesn't seem to be much progress at the Agenda 2000 meetings in Europe. France, Ireland and a few more don't want to see any change in agricultural support to at least 2006. There seems a partial decoupling agreement will win the day, which I agree with.



Week 73
Still cold and wet this week. Lambs are not looking as well as they did. Spring barley is going a bit yellow with all the rain, and is in need of some sun and heat. Went to a meeting at Penrith this week and met some of the other people from all walks of life who are writing these diaries. It was interesting to hear their thoughts and opinions of F and M and how it affected their way of life. What stood out was none of us had a high opinion of the government or DEFRA, and as the vet said if we have another outbreak he doesn't think DEFRA will handle it any better. God help us!

Week 74
We have been having a lot of trouble this last few months with the BCMS at Workington. We are owed a lot of subsidy from last year and the RPA will not pay up until the mistakes are put right. Every farmer I speak to has the same problem. It is a disgrace with the number of staff they have how they can make so many mistakes. I don't think DEFRA realised what they were taking on when they set BCMS up.
Had a day off at the races at Kelso this week. The local discussion group have an away day every May and it is good to get away from the usual chores for change. It also turned out very profitable.

Week 75 
There seems to be a lot of farmers have started to make silage these last few days, but a lot of rain at the weekend has put a stop to it. Crops seem to be very heavy this year but very wet. I've heard of one or two silage pits collapsing round about. We are still lambing but it is slowing down to a trickle. Have been selling fat hoggs this last week or so, the prices are still good, as there is not a lot of spring lambs around yet. Since the F and M farmers don't seem to be lambing as early as they used to. It is a lot less expensive if you lambing April when the weather is good and the grass is growing.

Week 76
Crops and grass are really growing now. After all the rain in May the weather is a lot warmer now. There seems to be some big crops of silage been cut and farmers are fetching it in really fast. A lot different to last year when you could hardly walk on the land. We are still lambing just one or two a day. But with sun and warm weather they are doing well from the word go. Spring lambs are still very dear, let's hope they stay that way for the rest of the year. After last year's poor harvest barley is getting scarce and expensive to buy. We are feeding black-and-white bulls and it is costing £800 a week to feed them so roll on harvest.

Week 77
We have been trying to hunt up some clippers this last day or two. The team that has clipped our sheep for the last 10 years have packed in. One of them has rented a farm so he doesn't think he will have time to spend weeks away from home. Since F and M there seems to be a few ""one-man bands"" that have disappeared from rural life. We used to have Mole and Rat catchers come around but they all seem to have gone now, maybe they are still working for DEFRA. The winter barley is starting to ripen very quick now, I would think we will be harvesting by the middle of July, let's hope there are no thunderstorms or high winds until harvest. 

Week 78
There is still no agreement in Europe over the reforms of the CAP. It is affecting the prices of young stock, as farmers don't know whether there will be any subsidy or not next year. You can't claim subsidy until animals are seven months old. Most experts predict that there will be some sort of decoupling but don't know what. France doesn't want any changes until 2006. The weather gets better and better. I have never seen the countryside looking so green. Most farms have never had as much grass or silage. It must have been the dry weather in March and April back.

Week 79
Still waiting on sheep clippers to come. Expected them last weekend but it rained all day on Saturday. The rain did a lot of good as the ground is very dry and starting to crack. Most people finished silaging and a few are making hay. The latest from Europe is that decoupling will start in 2005. This will give farmers two years to plan what they are going to do after subsidies. The government believes that prices will rise but that remains to be seen. The food trade has a habit of importing a lot more if it gets too expensive to buy at home.

Week 1

Monday 
Drove past the burial site at Great Orton, now renamed Watchtree.  From the road it looks like a huge pile of mud.  The locals at my end of the village hope to arrange an on site visit, we need at least 10 people for a tour.  The road is more hole than road and after so much rain recently the holes are large puddles.  I went to tour to the Enterprise Centre to do my job search then went to the Job Centre to sign on.  Back home then I went round to my neighbour’s, her 2 children have not been well, the one year old girl has had a viral infection and the 6 year old boy has swollen tonsils.

Tuesday
I’ve just heard via mum that my brother went to the Watchtree site for a visit, he is on his local village Council.  I must phone him to ask his views and what the visit was like.  Went to Enterprise Centre again.  Then appointment with Employment Alternatives.  Went swimming in the evening.

Wednesday 
Although it’s great to have all the sights and sounds and smell of the countryside back to normal, there’s an awful smell coming in from the farmers spreading slurry in the fields.  It’s nowhere near as bad as the smell of rotting carcases from last year or the smoke from the fires.  I went shopping, on the way home I met a large tanker, it’s really quite frightening meeting a huge vehicle on these small country roads.  I stopped and he didn’t even pull over!  Or slow down!  I came to interview me.

Thursday 
I phoned around a few schools to try to get a placement.  The head teacher at K has agreed.  That’s good news.  Went round to friend’s for lunch, I took some homemade soup.  After lunch I went into town for an appointment at 1.30.  Later I went to visit mum then to K School to meet head teacher and look around the school. I arranged to go on a Wednesday morning for 2 hours voluntary work as part of the course I’m doing.

Friday 
Started on a training course – helping in schools at Kirkbridge CDC.  I really enjoyed it, there were 12 of us on the course.  I was quite intense.  I went home, had lunch then went into town to get 2 new car tyres but decided to go back on Monday as it was very busy at Denton Tyres.

Saturday 
Worked on a friend’s computer doing course work.  Did some clothes washing and general household chores.  In the evening I went to Penrith for and Italian meal with 8 friends.

Sunday 
Spent more time on computer after visiting my sister.  Had lunch at her house.  A couple of friends phoned.  I watched TV and filled in diary.


Week 2

Monday
Went to friend’s house then we went to the gym.  I had 2 tickets for 7 consecutive days free trial at Classic World of Fitness.  We enjoyed it.  Went on cycles first then the treadmill and running machine and finished up on the toning tables.  Back at friend’s house we had lunch, more homemade soup.  Had a message on my mobile from mum, she wanted me to pick her up and take her to her doctors appointment.  I did that and dropped her off and headed off to the Enterprise Centre for a couple of hours to do a job search.  Afterwards I went back to Denton Tyres.

We went down to Kendal to the food lovers festival, which turned out to be a worth while trip.  Then we went to the shopping village in Kendal, walked into Kendal, had a look round the shops.  Then drove back to the campsite.  Had a cuppa, then off to the beer festival.  The weather has changed.  It’s still warm but drizzly.

Week 16

Monday
Started work at 10.30, made  leek and potato soup, then made some fruit scones.  Also made some flapjacks.  We had a fairly quiet afternoon.  (I’m glad that I wasn’t in work yesterday as it was a very busy day, there was an antiques fair on and they took £800 on food and drinks, in the restaurant.)
Went home, didn’t do much, watched TV, talked on the phone to a few friends.  Went to bed at midnight.  A showery day and cold today.

Tuesday
Went to work, made soup for tomorrow.  Made a pasta and mushroom special.  It was a quiet day today so after lunch I did some cleaning ready for tomorrow’s inspection.  One girl was moaning all day and not pulling her weight.  Couldn’t wait to go home.  Went swimming at night, did more talking than swimming but enjoyed it.  Went to bed at 11.30.

Wednesday
Went to doctors before work.  Couldn’t believe how much prescriptions are!  When I arrived at work I found that the manager was off ill.  I made rock buns and banana cake, later in the day I made egg mayo, coleslaw and prepared carrots for tomorrow’s soup.  We had a party of 18, 8 year olds, so I cooked their food.  Then decided to take charge and got someone to do something about our ant problem.  This worked, some one came.  Then I had words with the girl who hasn’t been pulling her weight.  The inspection didn’t happen today after all.  When I got home I watched a programme about army life which was filmed last year.   It showed them in Staffordshire making a fire for the sheep carcasses.   This brought back the awful memories of foot and mouth locally!

Thursday
At work for 9 o’clock today.  Made salad garnish, baked potatoes and baguettes.  Made carrot and orange soup, then baked some scones.  Served food orders, we had a visit from the big boss.  Called in at chip shop on way home.

Tuesday
Started work at 9 today.  Had quite an enjoyable day.  Finished at 5pm.  Went to my brothers to start painting his fence, then went home for some pasta, went swimming.  Feeling tired tonight after my 9 days working in a row.  Now I have 3 days off, brilliant, I expect they will go by really quickly!

Called in to visit a friend and stayed for some salad.  Went home, packed my bag and drove up the road to Edinburgh to stay the night with a friend.

Thursday
Got woken up early and we went tot the Highland show.  Had a great day.  The show was cancelled last year due to F&M.  I really missed it along with all the other agricultural show.  The weather held out, it only rained for about an hour in the afternoon.  Got home late in the evening and went straight to bed.

Friday
Weather not brilliant today.  Cold and showery.  I went to a friends house then we went out to Penrith and had lunch at a garden centre.

Saturday
Still rotten weather.  I worked 9 – 5, I was meant to be working 9 – 3 but was asked to stay for 2 extra hours as it was very busy.  The day went very quickly.  Went to visit mum after work.  Got home, made as few phone calls, delivered boxes to next door ready for their move next week.

Tuesday
Drove to Carlisle to the Enterprise Centre only to find we’ve been sent to the wrong building to do basic food hygiene certificate.  Got sent up to hill top heights.  Spent the day there, rather boring really because it’s basically all common sense.  After leaving there in afternoon I filled up with fuel and got milk at Tesco’s then went home.  Went swimming in evening.

Wednesday
The weather is still cold and dull with showers.  The day started well.  I was in a good mood and feeling quite happy.  When I got to work, the other girl wasn’t there and turned up 20 minutes late which left me sitting waiting like a wet lettuce, wondering what had happened.  So that was a bad start to my day, then the day never seemed to get any better and I ended up getting annoyed with everything.  We also got quite busy for a while.  That night straight after work I drove up to Dumfries for my friends daughter’s school prize giving award ceremony.  Then I stayed the night.

Thursday
An early start, after a quick tea and toast I drove back to Carlisle.  When I drove into the car park there was a strange noise as I turned the wheel, when I got out and looked under the car there was some liquid pouring out.  I phoned my Garage and my friendly mender man came to pick up the car and fix it.  Luckily he was able to fix it and put a second hand pump in for the power steering.  I now have the worry of paying for it!  We has a new girl started at work today, she’s only part-time, but seems nice enough.  Went to the pub in evening with neighbours as my next door neighbours are moving on Monday.

Friday
It’s a lovely sunny day for a change.  Feeling very tired today.  Feeling unhappy and fed up with work.  It felt like a really long day today.  Got home and did nothing.  Had an early night.

Awoke early, went to work at 9 o’clock. A long day today.  Finished at 6pm.  This has to be the warmest day of the year, very sunny and hot all day long.  Makes a lovely change.  Had an annoying day at work as we seem to have run out of so many things, whilst I’ve been off for a few days.  The ordering has gone to pot!!  It was so bad that I ended going to Morrisons to buy brown bread, bread roles and beef burgers for tomorrow’s parties.  So I didn’t finish work till 6.45pm.

Thursday
I arrived at work at quarter to 9, no one else there yet.  Typical!  Then when the boss arrived at 9 she went straight back out to buy milk!  She says we now have to buy mild from the supermarket instead of our suppliers as it’s cheaper.  Talk about crazy.  The place is run on a thread, never mind a shoe string!!  What a pain that is going to be, especially when it’s her days off.  As always I was busy all day.  Doing temp checks and food preps.  Making orders and children’s food for 51 at summer camp.  Then a party for 10.  The good news is that A is leaving, she is the one nobody likes much and is very lazy.  When R our only male came in at 4, I told him and he was really pleased as they don’t get on at all and she bosses him about.  I left work at 4 and went to mum’s, got changed then went to a party for a 5 yr old at the Magic Castle where I was attached by a mad 5 yr old on the bouncy castle.

Wednesday
At 4:45 this morning a loud crashing sound downstairs woke me.  It turned out to be a picture, the string broke.  When the picture fell it broke the electrical socket cover.

Saturday
Working today in the awful heat.  They were polishing the floor in the main hall, so the fumes made my head hurt.  Today was not a soup day.  The weather is far too humid.  It was an ice lolly and lager shandy day today.  I expect it’ll rain tomorrow on my day off.  Went to Wigton and washed car after work.  Come home, took neighbours dog for a walk.  More phone calls.  Watched TV and went to bed with a headache.

Feeling headachy and very tired.  Fell asleep watching TV.

Tuesday
Called into Kwik Save on way to work to buy bread rolls for kids break.  Had a good day today, probably ‘cos the boss is on holiday!

Dairies 28 - 42
12th September, after a leisurely breakfast we left at 10 o’clock then sat in traffic for hours. It was 12.30 when we got to the show, a journey which should have taken 20 minutes took 2½ hours. We had a stand to promote country link and we held a raffle with 4 hampers of food as prizes, we raised £174.00 for the RABI (Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution). It was a very long day out and my throat was hurting, so was my head. We left the show field at 7pm and made our way home. I tried to drive down the closed road but came across a trench through the road so I had to reverse back up the road. They’re making passing places all along the road, does this mean we will be getting lots more traffic (i.e. lorries) up at the airfield? I mean  to say the Watchtree site.

1st October, On the way home I noticed a new Watchtree sign, which seems rather pointless as everyone already knows where the site is!

Monday 28th January
Monday - I didn't feel well on Monday, came to work and got all my paperwork up to date and because it was so quiet went home early and watched TV in front of fire.
Tuesday I felt better and got the accounts on the computer up to date.  Placed some orders to arrive in time for half term, might be a busy week?  Watched TV, then went to the pub.
Wednesday the shop was closed and I had seen on the local news last night there is an exhibition of artwork on in Kendal that interested me, so I went with a friend to look and bought 3 pictures which I really liked.  Had a look round Kendal then came home and the Travel Agents phoned to say the holiday I had booked had fallen through., and it would cost another £250 for a similar holiday in a poorer hotel.  I went mad at them as they have messed us about and were totally unapologetic, and told them to shove the holiday.  Told the rest of the boys and they said to pay the extra or we wouldn't get a holiday at all.  One of the lads phones to do that as I didn't want to talk to the travel agents again as they had really got my back up.
Thursday the engineer arrived at work to put in the new tagging system.  Once he had done that I spent the rest of the day swapping over old tags for new ones.  At home I just tidied up a bit and read for the rest of the night.
Friday I continued swapping tags over, then a friend who used to live in the village but moved to Birmingham came to visit.  After work he came to my house and we got drunk and went to the pub, there was a good crowd out, a good night.
Saturday I tidied up a bit, watched football results then went to a party in Carlisle at a friends house.  Lots of students and some very pretty Spanish girls.  Got drunk and had a good night.
Sunday woke up on sofa, breakfast was the buffet leftovers, then went to se my website designer (who is a good friend) sorted a few things out then came home to watch Man Utd win 2-0.  Hooray!!  An antique dealer friend came round at night and we listened to music and talked for hours.  


Monday 4th February

Wednesday, another good day at work on my own, good crowd of customers. Friendly and a good laugh. Took dog for another long walk then watched England match with friends. Good match. Showed promise. Mum and Dad are back and took the dog home, then went to a friends to play on a new Playstation 2 game. Excellent. I'll have to save up for a Playstation 2.
Thursday, woke up full of cold with a streaming nose. Another busy day at work but I wasn't as enthusiastic as the last few days. Customers were very kind and patient with me though, as I kept running off to blow my nose. Went home and just stayed in watching T.V by the fire, and blowing my nose a lot.
Friday, woke up feeling much better, the sun was shining. It was yesterday as well. It's lovely to get a nice fresh day after all the rain and wind. Busy at work, had to stay back to put new stock on computer. Got home late, had tea then went to pup.

Monday, hung over at work, didn't really do anything, came home and didn't move off the sofa.
Tuesday, very quiet at work, it's half term and we should be busy, went to Safeway after work and bought a huge steak. I hardly ever cook so this was quite an event. Had my tea and just watched telly for the rest of the night.
Wednesday, another quiet day. It's worse when you think your going to be busy and your all geared up for action, but the day never really gets going. Makes the days drag. Watched the football, one all draw, not too bad. I've got tickets for the home match next week. Should be good. Went to the pub for one after the match then home to bed.
Thursday, started to organise things for while I'm on holiday. Put in a few orders for top ups from some suppliers, so they turn up and I can get them on the computer and out on the shop floor. Trying to organise it so nothing turns up while I'm away. Went to trade show at Skelwith Bridge with Dad. Saw a few things that will be good for next Autumn/winter. Stopped at the Queens at Troutbeck for supper on the way back. Had a really nice meal then came home, watched Kylie on telly, what a fine creature she is. Went to pub.
Friday, I started going through my forward orders that are due in March. I reduced the quantities on a few where it looked like we had too much coming in, and changed the delivery date so that nothing should come whilst I'm away. Went to the pub and it started snowing. Had a good night and a brilliant snowball fight on the way home.
Saturday, morning, opened the curtains, snow everywhere. About 10 through the night. The road to work was blocked, so went to the golf course to snowboard, but not steep enough. Drove around and found a good hill. Boarding all afternoon, then went to pick Dad up from work. He had walked there with the dog, but had a very quiet day. Went to the pub later on, had a good crack then another snowball fight. Ace.
Sunday went to a trade show in Manchester, saw some friends I hardly ever see and had a good day looking at stuff for next Autumn/winter. Got home about tea time and some friends came round, had a drink and played cards, I lost, then went to the pub for last orders. Snow not good for snowballs anymore, but the road is all ice, made some good slides down the hill. Fell over loads.

Tuesday, brought my computer from home and did loads of bills, but the work printer doesn't work with my computer so I couldn't print any receipts. Stayed back till after 10 to get caught up.
Wednesday, brought my printer to work and phoned Barclays so they told me how to print receipts for payments already made. Spent all day until 9 doing invoices and trying to make a dent on my in tray. Got home about 9.30 and went to the pub.  
Thursday. Stock started turning up today, but I haven't got a record of what I ordered as it's all on the computer. Went through to see M but he needs the original disks to get anything done. I've got loads to do but told Dad to have today and tomorrow off as we won't get any time off for a couple of weeks.
Friday. I've had to spend all day on the shop floor as I'm on my own. Put in a few top up orders for Easter, but it's still very quiet. Kids break up for a fortnight today though. Went out in town tonight for a males birthday. Got really pissed and nearly arrested for pissing in the street. I really shouldn't drink tequila.
Saturday, went to the accounts to get my book's and disks back, then went to work and spent an hour on the phone with the accountant talking me through doing the VAT. Came home and just stopped in.
Sunday, working with P, always fun. It was muck busier today and lots of people are here for the week. I hoped to get some paperwork done today but didn't get a chance, which isn't a bad thing. Just stopped in watching telly after work.  

Monday 25th March
Monday, new stands turned up, got them put together and all the new stock on the computer after we closed. Been busy with customers, looks like it should be a good week, weathers good too. Didn't leave till after 10 getting everything on to the computer.
Tuesday, God knows what's got into Dad. He's fallen out with me about Friday night. He just laughed when I told him on Saturday. He's been sulking all day and I've got loads of work to do but he's being pathetic. Busy with customers, should be buzzing but Dads doing my head in.
Wednesday, told Dad to stop being pathetic. My personal life is nothing to do with him. Busy with customers, stock turning up, I'm knackered but the work has to be done. If I'm working all the time like this I need to blow out now and again. Stayed back till 10 rearranging the shop and trying to get all the new stuff out on the computer.
Thursday, Mum came down and we did the display windows at the hotel. Really pleased with the displays we did. Paid more bills, with all the stock turning up. 

Monday 1st April
Monday - Another busy day, had the duck race in the Beckside but |I didn't win.  It raised over £2000 for the mountain Rescue Team though.  Came home and did nothing.

Tuesday - Quieter at work but still a good day.  Looks like the week will carry on good.  Went to Safeways, that was packed. Cooked a stir fry for tea, then went to the pub.
Wednesday - Still kept busy put in a load of orders to replace Easter Sales.  I didn't expect it to be that busy so went canny on my stock levels.  I might have trouble keeping stocked up properly if all outdoor shops will be shouting out for stock like I hope |I will be.  Watched man U beat Departio 2-0 away.  I've got tickets for the home match next week.
Thursday - Some new display stands turned up but haven't had a chance to do them.  A busy day and late finishing.  Went to the pub with Ali from next door who's home from the Army for a few days. 

Friday - Hard getting out of bed this morning, I'm dying for a lie in tomorrow. Kept busy again all day, I've stacks of things that need doing but haven't had a chance to get off the shop floor.  Went to the pub but came home early because I was falling asleep.

Saturday - Woke up at 8.30 and couldn't get back to sleep. All I wanted was a lie in.  Went to Carlisle with Martin and got my car stereo fixed, got wiper for the car and went for breakfast.

Wednesday - Sorted out all the hats on the new hat stands, did loads of work on sage, nearly up to date now.  Left at 4 to go to the match. Good drive down, went to the Trafford Arms for one then down to the match.  Absolutely brilliant performance, we're going to win even without Keane and Beckham, who's out for 8 weeks with a broken foot.  Good drive back, got out and on the motorway in no time. 

Thursday - On my own at work, went through all the 2002 price lists and brought everything up to the correct price. Was meant to be going biking after work but didn't finish until' late.  Went round to see J instead, then came home, went to the pub and quite early to bed.

Sunday - Got suited up and arrived at church late.  I hate church, it's all such bollocks. Went to L house for christening lunch but I hated it.  Children everywhere and baby talk.  Left after main course and played tennis for a couple of hours, then got chips and smoky for tea and stopped in watching telly.




Monday 15th April
Monday - Dad's been really tired and narky.  I told him to go home but he wouldn't.  Left him on the shop floor and I got a lot done upstairs.  Stocked up at Safeways, cleaned my car wheels with some special alloy cleaner and they came up a treat.  Took pictures to J to frame and stayed in.

Monday 22nd April
Monday - had a good day putting the wages onto Sage.  Almost everything was easy but had to ring (the accountant) a few times.

Didn't get home 'til late and just stayed in.

Wednesday - Went through the last of the old hangers and got the shop ship shape.  Everything on a new hanger with a new size cube should make it easier for customers.  Took a huge box of hangers to the Sun for Mike. Sorted out 'Paramo' for Autumn/Winter, then Thomas from PR books came.  His wife has left him and I tried to be supportive.  He's a really nice bloke but can be a bit of a wet week-end.  Biked down to the Sun after work to watch the match on the big screen.  Excellent match but 2-2 draw isn't enough. We'll have to do better next week.

Sunday - Took L home then went to the Sun for dinner.  Came home and did nothing all day. Just watched telly feeling hung over.  D came round after work. He left mine at 3am this morning and was starting work at 5 am. He looked worse than I felt.  Ha, ha!!!

Monday 29th April
No one has phoned about the job over the week-end.  I really hope we get someone. Did my week-end and month end stuff on the computer then started all the stock control computer invoicing.  Did that all day then went to Safeways on the way home.  Made a big healthy salad then stayed in reading.

Tuesday - Carried on with the invoicing and got it all finished.  Brilliant!!  A girl phoned about the job and came for an interview.  I think she should be fine.  She's talkative, intelligent and enjoys the outdoors.  Arranged with dad to have most of next week off to do some decorating.  Came home in a brilliant mood ready for us to win the semi-final a secure a place at Glasgow.  What a let down.  They only played well for the last 20 minutes.

Fri
Feeling a bit better but the swelling is turning in into boils on my face. I look scabby.  Quit at work except for a couple of deliveries. I’m ring to make sure we have full stock of everything now in time for the summer hols then hopefully I won’t have to order much more just sell, sell, sell, whilst the kids are on holiday and we are (hopefully) busy.  JM came through Carlisle for the night and to go on a bike ride tomorrow. Went round to see J and l and L cooked a load of nachos.  Went to the pub with J and J and had one pint.  I’m sure it won’t stop the antibiotics working.

Sat
I didn’t go out on the bike cause of my face still hurting it has gone down a lot.  Went into town with M had a look around the market did some chores and got suited up for tonight.  I finished my antibiotics so tonight I drink.  Went to the pub about 6 and the bus from town for the wedding picked us up from there.  K looked really nice and all the lads had scrubbed up brilliantly. It was an ace night and everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves. Bus took us home at 2ish.

Sun
Watched the final and Brazil won. I’m so glad. If Germany had won I would have started WW11 went to Patterdale for the Ullswater Fair but it was raining really hard so did a lap of the field then went to the Ramblers where last night’s party was, for some dinner.  Everything M ordered was off so poor lad starved whilst we all ate like Kings.  Came back to T and went to the pub for the rest of the night.


1ST July

Woke up late and flew to Keswick for dentist – she had a good poke about which hurt and she said my wisdom tooth is growing through wonky and will have o come out. Back to Penrith to pick up the hoover from work which died last week then came to work. Feeling rough and quite busy all afternoon. Planned a quiet night but O and K came to see me before their honeymoon so went to the pub for a few.  They showed me their wedding photos, nice.

Tuesday
Feel human, busy with customers and paper work, got loads done and had a really good trading day. Sent evening cleaning and hovering and being domesticated.

Weds
Another busy day. The weather is perfect for us. Mixed.  Not too wet to make everyone go home but enough rain to drive them in for waterproofs and general shopping instead of walking. Ace!!  Hopefully we will stay busy through to October now. Had a great night with J a mate I haven’t see for years and W and D and M all cracking all night.  Good to have all the boys around and catch up with good mates.

Thurs
Hopefully the last of the really big deliveries came in this morning, should just be smaller top ups from now on unless we’re really busy and sell it al and need a load more stock.  That would be nice. Quite busy again got all the paperwork up to fate before I go off next week. Went to Ws after work. He’s doing well getting his new house sorted. It’s looking good.

Fri
Quieter again today. Making progress trying to get the local Moutain Rescue Team into ‘Paramo’ clothing.  ‘Paramo’ are dead keen. It’s a just trying to persuade the team to move on from Gore-tex.  My new water filter turned up so I borrowed it for J..  I was going to wash my car but got dragged to the pub early with M and D  Got drunk.

Sat
Went into town to do some shopping and pay some bills, came back and watched telly.  Came round and went to Safeways. Came back, had a big stir fry and went to Glenridding for the fireworks.  Went on the beach and played with huge fireworks from proper displays.  Totally dangerous firing them into the lake and blowing trees up. Ace.  Came home when everyone went to the part.  I cam home sober ‘cause I’ve got work tomorrow but the whole of Glenridding was slaughtered (drunk).  It’s always a good party at the Headlands.

Sun
Did paperwork ‘cause it was quiet, got the maps I need for tomorrow off Marion.  Came home and packed.  Went to Morley for a while then came home for an early night.  Holiday tomorrow.

Sun
Didn’t get up until after 1pm feeling rough. I had wanted to go out on my today but I feel far too wobbly.  Went to the pub for lunch and had a couple of beers but they didn’t help too much.  Went for a walk and set off the rockets Richard gave me for my birthday.  One just flew up and bombed back onto the ground, the other and landed at the top of the only tree in the field. Great.  Came back t play with fireworks but only a few went off.  Went back to the pub, after a Chinese in Morley’s garden, had another couple and came home and had a quiet one.

15th July
Mon
Office day all day with only a couple of distractions.  Graham from W knives called by.  He says loads of his customers around the Lakes are quieter this year than last.  We’re having a good year but this mixed weather is perfect for us. Not too wet to send everyone home but enough showers to get people in for water proofs.  Can’t grumble. Just stayed in and watched telly after a trip to Safeways and a visit to W’s in town.

Tuesday Red hot day. People constantly coming in and telling us how nice it is outside while we cook inside.  It’s been a long day but went out on the bikes for a good long ride.  Martin got 3 punctures and I got eaten by midges waiting for him to mend them.  Went to the h for a pint  and to escape the midges – then a leisurely ride home.  Good night!!

Weds
Kept busy at work.  C came for the diaries. Had an hour to kill before the dentist so I hovered my car. What a difference it makes. Dentist said my wisdom tooth is coming through fine, no need to do anything. Ace!!  Got home and went to Morley’s. Had a kick about with the football then played play station at D, J was through for a while. Good crack then off home.

Thursday Got a call from Alarm company at 7am, not going off but something wrong. Flew down the road and the alarm was ringing but really feebly. Called alarm co.but I had to wait til 9 o’clock to call local company or they charge a fortune for a call out.  Went home, had a shower then picked up Ruth and came back.  Engineer got here by 10.30 and shut the alarm up.  Arranged for a rep to come on Monday and put in a more reliable alarm system.  Ruth did one of the windows with a new display and it looks ace.  Went to see Solomon footwear for Spring/Summer 2003 with [new girl] after work and they have dropped our best selling boot.  Just came home and watched telly.

Fri
Marion did the other window so they both look fresh and inviting.  I washed the windows and all the woodwork so the shop entrance looks really good now.  I was late finishing after I had redone all the prices for the window displays.  Got home and Will is up from Nottingham for the night.  So went to the pub with him, got a bit drunk and a few people came back to mine but I was knackered and had to chuck them out so I could get to be.

Sat
Went to D’s Diner for breakfast then went to pick up Mum so she could get some shopping in town. She’s not feeling too good and didn’t want to drive.  Sorted her out and took her home, then went to Carlisle with Martin for a serious day’s shopping. Got a tuxedo for £10 from a charity shop, a new telly and DVD on Elvis org and Jack Nicholoson mask. Terrible football game and ordered an Elvis suit. All on the credit card, that’s gona hurt. Went to see M but my computers knackered 
Came back home and got changed into the tux. Looking good. D ran me, Martin and J to Lemming House for the classical concert on the lawns. Saw loads of folk I know + the tux + Jack mask went down a treat. Got pretty drunk in the Pimms tent and everyone kept telling me and Martin to shush. We were only giggling. Got a lift to Toppers after the concert and got really drunk. Met L (my ex) in there and she ended up in my taxi back home

Sun
Went to get Mum about 1ish with Martin and we went to Allonby to a big car boot sale. I got a smart print and a flashing light for my car. Had a huge dinner at Allonby then went for a walk along the beach with Mum, Martin and Mum’s dog. Mum showed me the house they are buying there. It looks ace. Came back and started as bit of DIY to get my new telly on the shelf, had to get some wood from Martins to make the shelf bigger. Came back with good DIY intentions but everyone was going to the pub so I went for a few with them. Came back relatively sober.


July Monday 22nd 
Did accounts most of the day, had a guy from the alarm company come to quote us on a better system that won’t go off and ring the police all the time. Went to see Saleva at Threlkeld, a few bits of interest but not much. Went to the Horse and Farrier at Threlkeld with Mum and Dad for tea them came. After 10.50 when I got in so no DIY tonight.

Tuesday 23rd 
Still nowhere near as busy as it should be for the summer holidays. Sorted out my office and filling cabinet. Really ruthless. Threw loads of stuff out. DIY when I got home drilling and cutting and painting. It will take another few days yet because the shelf will need a few coats.

Wednesday 24th
Still quiet. It was busier before the schools broke up. Got the telly wired up and working another coat on the shelf

Thursday 25th
Still quiet. I’ve been going through my forward orders and cancelling loads of stuff. If its going to carry on like this I’ll just have to sell what we’ve got and not bring in any more stock. J came through after work and we went to meet W. Went to the curry house for a feast and much larger. J brought me home and I put hopefully the last coat on the shelf. Considering I was drunk I did a good job.

Friday 26th
Paid our tax and load of invoices. Got everything up to date on the accounts. It’s still quiet, not dead, about the same as before the school holidays but it should be much busier. C came round after work, so did W , D and Morley. Had a few beers at mine then went to the pub. Came back and I wasn’t tired but Martin was doing my head in snoring on the sofa so I dragged him into the spare room and watched telly for a bit. Woke up on the sofa at 4 a.m. I hate doing that.

Saturday 27th
Had a lie in till 10. Martin brought me a take away breakfast from Doug’s Dinner. Beautiful! Went to town to do a few chores, took 40 minutes to drive through town. Penrith show’s on today so that would have made it busier but a lot of the traffic must have been tourists thought we must get busier now. Got to work and it was still quiet. Got the stock control computer up to date with bleep all afternoon. Got home and went to the pub for tea. Everyone was really drunk from being at Penrith show all day. L came through and ended up staying at mine again. Good fun though.

Sunday 28th
Reluctantly got out of bed and went to work. Still quiet so I backed everything up on the computer and deleted the old files and totally tidied it up. I’ve got everything totally up to date now. Took Mums dog for a walk and she pinched a little girls ice cream. Thankfully her Mum and Dad were nice about it but I’m not letting the dog of the lead till after the summer when there’s less people about. Had a dreadful takeaway from Burger King for tea and just stayed in watching telly 

29th July
Mon 29th
Put in a few orders on things we are getting low on, did the weekend stuff and it was a bit better today. Busier that the weekend. Maybe people are starting to turn up?

It’s his birthday but I haven’t had a chance to get him anything. Had a few beers that came home.

Tue 30th
Red hot, really stuffy, sweat dripping all the time etc Had a lot of rain this afternoon and thunder and lightning and a power cut. Great. For about an hour we couldn’t use the till or credit card machine and the security system wasn’t working so we only let nice looking people in. Power came back so we put everything through the till and credit card machine and got caught up. I’m meant to be going to another Tredle show tonight but I can’t be bothered. It’s not important and I’m too hot and bothered. Just going home. Stayed in and watched telly.

Wed 31st
J from Montane who I was meant to see last night came through this morning and went through everything. Did a load of work on Sage afternoon then went crazy when I got home and cleaned the kitchen from top to bottom. Spotless! Took over three hours though. Went to pub with J, then round to his for a bit then home

Thurs 1st 
Quite busy. Kept going all day anyway. Packed for the weekend and had a quiet night.

We were the first at the hotel, had a few beers and some tea, then when everyone from the stag weekend was there got a taxi to the lap dancing club. Oh my God. Beautiful ladies shaking them in your face for only a fiver a time. Left there and went to Flairs, a 70s style nightclub. Excellent atmosphere and really good fun. Dancing and buggering about.

Monday 19th
Quite busy at work.  Put in a few top up orders for the bank Holiday week-end, did my week-end paperwork. Went out with Martin on the bikes then stopped in.

Fri 23rd
Quieter at work, hope it’s the calm before the storm.  Quiet night in.  I could tell you what I watched on telly to pad this out a bit, but I really have been boring this week and don’t have anything of interest to say.

Sat 24th
A good busy day.  Wet enough to send them in for waterproofs but not too wet to send them home.  I had worked the staff out to give Dad the week-end off, but he insisted on coming in, so there were too many of us to be kept busy.  The day drags when it’s like that.  Went to WL’s barby after work.  A really good night and moderate on the booze.

Sun 25th
Not quite as busy as yesterday but it’s a nicer day.  People are out walking instead of shopping.  Still over staffed , day dragged, quiet night in.


Monday 26th August

Went to see my brother Richard and his family, then saw Morley for a bit, went up to J and L’s, they fed me and I put some new software on L’s computer.  Went to the pub with Jonny, few beers, few games of pool, then home.

Fri
Horrible wet day and no customers.  Bored.  Went into town with Morley and drank a lot of shooters and Asbsynth.  Very drunk and wobbly.  Went round the pubs and Morley wanted to go home but I wanted to stay in town drinking.  Don’t remember anything.

Tuesday Quiet again but a few good sales.  Once you’re into September it goes quiet, but the people generally have more money and appreciate better products and good service, so we can do it al right.  Watched Man United, Middlesborough with W and Morley and some beers.  Good match. Good craic.




Weds 4th

Wednesday
Quieter today, saw Jane from Wynnster and sorted out my Autumn/Winter forward orders, not taking in as much  as I had wanted, but have to sell Spring/Summer stock first.  Jayne is going out on the horses with Marion this evening so she was well excited.  Stopped in to watch the news all night.  I was sure something would have happened today, but unless their covering it up (which is more than likely) no terrorist activity.



Thursday
A bit busier and Neil from North cape came so I sorted out all of our Spring/Summer range from them.  Went to Skelwith Bridge after work to see Sarpa and Horlo, Contour and Grivel.  Sorted all of those out for next Spring and had a good crack with Steve and Steve.  They asked me to stay for a bar meal but it's the new series of the X files tonight and I didn't set the video.  How sad is that?  Got home in time for a double episode though.  Ace, worth missing a meal for.

Friday
The world didn't end on 9/11, so it's bound to happen today.  Saw Mickey from Tenson and sorted out my range from them for the spring, but it's been quiet besides that.  Went to the pub but didn't get too pissed and came back early, just wasn't in a partying mood.

Saturday
Had quite a civilised day today. Had a lie in then washed and hoovered the car.  Hoovered the house and had a tidy up.  Did some chores in town then came home and had tea.  Went into town with W and martin and ate loads.  Got really pissed and don't remember much else.

Sunday
Feel like hell.  Got up about 12, watched telly, had to go to Carlisle to meet Cowie but W drove as I wasn't up to it.  Got back feeling better then came back to pick up J and N and went to Keswick to the Great Soprendo.  A magician that used to be on Crackerjack.  He was really good. Did some amazing tricks.  Brought everyone home and went to bed.


Monday 16th September
Monday
Booked flights to France for [me and two friends].  Booked hire car as well. Dead excited now.  Go and see Pete on the R for a week.  Did my office work then J picked me up from home for the Accounts Night Class. They hadn't put the Sage software on any of the computers so the night class was put off to start next week.  Went to find W then had a few beers round at mine.

Tuesday
Busy at work all day, then went to Grasmere to see ‘Celert's’ ranges for next Spring/Summer with Marion.  Some good stuff. Came home and had a quiet one.

Thursday
Very busy today and M came through to do work on the website.  Got the software on the computer and started settling up all the categories.  It's really easy to use and looks ace.  Went to Safeways for tucker then to the pub.

Friday
Busy again with customers and busy working on the website with M.  It's really coming together.  Went out in town with [friends].  Got leathered going round the pubs and had a right good laugh.  Taxi home about 12, didn't want to go to the night clubs because they're crap,

Saturday
Sat about for ages recovering then took M home to Carlisle.  Came back and went to the pub for a few early ones, then had an early night, lots to do tomorrow.


Sunday
Got up early and packed. Set off to Harrogate for the big trade show Go-Outdoors.  Got there at lunchtime, got booked in to my hotel then spent the afternoon going round the trade show.  Saw a few new groovy things to made plans for tonight.  Lee picked me up at 7 and went to the big meal and party.  Saw loads of people I only ever see at this trade show, ate loads, got drunk and had a really good night.  I intended to be back at the hotel by 12, but it was more like 2.


Monday 23rd September
Went to the George Hotel to do my window display course.  In the morning it was all merchandising and shop layout.  Didn't really learn anything. After lunch we were doing displays with stock and mannequins.  Picked up some good tips on dressing mannequins  and doing good displays.  I wouldn't say I learnt £250 worth of tips, which is the price of the course but that stuff will definitely help to make the shop and window more attractive.  Just ordered a pizza and watched telly in the hotel room all night.

Tuesday
Saw the last of my suppliers I needed to see at the show and my brother came through trying to get a job.  When I had done everything drove back home.  Gorgeous day and a lovely drive over the Pennines. Unpacked and got sorted out then watched the football.  Another ace match with the right result.  A few mates came round and we had a good night.

Wednesday
Starting to come down with a cold.  Feel really snotty.  Did accounts all day to make sure everything is up to date before I go away.  Just stopped in watching telly and sneezing.

Thursday
Spent the day putting together ranges from everything I saw at the Trade Show and getting all the orders faxed in.  Think I've ordered some really good lines, just hope I've got the quantities right.  Mum and Dad dropped the dog off for me to look after till Sunday.  They're away on a short break.  Finished work and took the dog for a walk then Louis (who's back from Manchester for a few days) picked me up and we went into town for a meal, with his bird and his little brother.  Ate far too much again so instead of going round the pubs we cam back to mine and chewed the fat feeling fat.

Friday
Got the last of my forward orders done.  I think next year's styles and colours are much better than this year.  Much brighter and jollier.  Just stopped in feeling really snotty.  Watched the last ever X files that I had taped last night. It's ace.

Saturday
Working with P and we're both full of snot.  Quite busy and good fun.  It's always good fun working with P. I was going to take the dog for a good run on Helton Fell to get rid of some of her energy, she's been bored and mischievous all afternoon but J rang to ask if he could come and watch the Newcastle match at mine cause I've got all the Sky Sports channels so I did that then took the dog out for a run in the dark later on.  Took (the dog) round to Morleys later on as [she]is good pals with Morleys dog.  Watched match of the day and had a few beers, then came home.

Sunday
Not too busy today, too nice a day, everyone's out walking instead of shopping.  Mum and dad came round to pick up the dog, they've had a good time in Harrogate. I'm feeling a lot better today which is very good news as I'm on holiday in the morning.  Stayed in and packed. Up early in the morning.


Monday 30th September
Slept in and woke at 7.  Have to be at airport for 9.  Pick up W and drove like a lunatic, got there dead on 9. That was too close.  Met B at the airport and flew to Nice.  Met P there and picked up the car.  Pete drove all the time cause he's used to it. Went to Entibbes for lunch and met K, had a good crack with her, then went on to the hotel in Cannes. Went to a couple of bars then a really nice seafood restaurant. Got the lobsters fighting over berries, had a gorgeous meal then went round a few more bars and then to bed at hotel.

Tuesday
Went back to Nice for code for the car stereo, had breakfast then sat on the beach all afternoon.  Went to see R at work, she's doing fine, then back to the hotel.  Found a bar with the football on, watched that and got leathered.  Can't remember anything more but I know I pissed W off by being rowdy.

Wednesday
Pete was working today so we sat on the beach at Cannes, most of the day, hung over.  Had a bit of a swim then met P at the port where he was bringing the boat in.  What an amazing boat he works on.  Huge and beautiful old wooden twin mast sailing boat.  Went for supper and had more lovely sea food, round a couple of bars then back to the hotel tired, but stayed up talking till 3.

Thursday
Drove over to St Tropez cause P wanted to see a man abut a job sailing in the Caribbean over the winter.  Just walked around oggling beautiful women.  Bumped into a guy from 'Animal' I was drinking with in Harrogate who is sailing a boat in the Regatta here. Went back to Cannes and had a few beers on P's lovely boat, then went to Entibbes but it was quiet.  So came back to Cannes and got slaughtered.  Ended up most of the night dancing in the Banana bar.

Friday
Went to the airport and slept all the way back.  Drove B down to Stoke, then drove home.  Got home about 9 absolutely knackered. Stopped in watching TV and sleeping.

Saturday
Martin picked me up in his new Alfa - beautiful very fast car. Went to Doug's Diner but my legs have seized up from dancing.  I can hardly move. Did a few chores about the house but today is mainly recovery. Stopped in at night and went to bed early.

Sunday
Back to work with a stack of paperwork and boxes everywhere.  Got a load done but there's more to do.  Went for a fine curry with J and W then to W's for some red booze. J dropped me off about 11 and I went straight to be.

Monday 4th  November
Quiet at work. Alan Mc our accountant came out to finalise all the hooha about becoming a limited company.  Did my Monday paperwork and just stopped in.

Tuesday
Quiet again, got started on the stock-take (my least favourite job).  Counted bar codes all day as I will be for the next fortnight. Stopped in again.

Weds
Counted all day, went to Safeways for a bit of shopping then went to the pub with J.

Thursday
A bit busier today but bloody customers keep interfering with my stock take. Just stayed in again.

Friday
Stock taking again.  A few more customers about.  Martin from Lyon Equipment came by to show me the new torches and gadgets.  Went to the pub and got pretty smashed, which is always good.

Saturday
Went to Dogs Dinner for breakfast, then had a good look around town and got a load of holiday brochures. Spent the afternoon looking on teletext for cheap holidays, got some beers in but just stayed in and had a quiet night.

Sunday
Had a totally lazy day. Hired out a couple of vids and just watched telly al day and night whilst eating cake and ice cream.  Ace.




Monday 11th  November
Quiet. Did may paperwork then carried on counting.  Just stayed in. I've been really boring through the week lately.  All I want to do when I finish work is put the fire on and watch telly. It's no good.  BORING!!!!

Tuesday
Counted in the morning, then went to see Jayne with Wynnster 2003 range in Kendal. They've got a really nice showroom there and we went through what I would be ranging for next year.  Came back to work and saw and old mate called Horsley.  He said he would come round tonight.  Went to another broad band meeting at Dacre with J and R and M had come through for this one.  It went well, and we can use the CLIO network at Glenridding.  Went to Costa's after the meeting, had grub and booze then came home.  M is staying overnight and Horsley came round for the night.  Morley came round and we went to the pub and got smashed, then stayed up boozing at mine until I don't know when. 

Wednesday
I think I was still drunk when I got up because I felt all right.  Came to work and started counting but the day got harder and harder as my hangover set in.  I've got tickets for the match tonight but feel to ill to drive to Manchester and can't be bothered with a late night.  Phoned round to give someone the tickets but to no avail.  Came home and watched the match with Morley then he went to the pub but I died on the sofa.

Thursday
Carried on counting again. Quiet with customers. Stayed in watching telly.

Friday
Nearly finished the stock take, if it wasn't for bloody browsers when I've got stuff to count upstairs, people can waste an HOUR   looking round the shop, then buy a bloody postcard.  I feel like telling them to get out and stop wasting my time!!  Went to the pub and got smashed, then carried on drinking at mine. L phoned but she wouldn't get a taxi out to mine.

Saturday
Went to Dogs for breakfast then had a wander round town. Went to the General Wolfe, a pub in town that's just had a revamp.  It used to be a good pub, bit of character but now it's just like a Yates' wine lodge.  Pants!  Went to Kendal to board on the dry slope but only got in a couple eof runs before it shut.  And I was appallingly bad.  Falling over all over the place.  How embarrassing.  Came home and got tanked up at mine then put on my new Elvis suit and went to the pub.  L was in the pub and so was just about everyone. The Elvis suit went down a treat. I truly am the King. A load of folk came back to mine for more booze and a good time was had by all.

Sunday
Had a good lie in then went to the Sun at P for lunch.  Came home and while I watched football Martin and D played on my motorbike outside. Football was crap but they had fun on the bike.  Took L home and got me and D a curry in town, then just watched telly all night.

Monday 18th November
Carried on counting, did my Monday office stuff and put in a few orders.  Stopped in watching telly AGAIN!!!

Tuesday - Another full day of counting and another full evening in front of the telly.

Wednesday - Finished the stock take!!  Could of finished yesterday if it wasn't for f**king browsers.  No more counting to be done and the stock control computer spot on.  Went through all the print outs to make sure cost price is right on everything and delete anything that's finished.  Yeeeeeeha!!  Went round to see jay and had a good crack on, then saw W for a bit then come home to watch football - Years 98-99, the finest year of English football ever. A real treat to relive that glorious week at the end of the season.

Thursday - Dad came down so I could have a full day telling all our suppliers that we are becoming a ltd. Company and let them know our new bank details.  Got nearly everyone done today. Stopped in again.

Friday - Got the suppliers I didn't tell yesterday done and then had quite a busy afternoon with customers that I wasn't expecting.  Martin and D came round after work and we got pretty smashed.  Went to the pub and carried on afterwards at D's.  Good fun. Caused havoc on Vice City.

Saturday - Went to 'Dogs' for breakfast, then went through to Carlisle to look for a motor bike.  No luck with finding a bike. Only saw one and it was dead expensive.  Had a look round a few shops and then came home.  Started boozing early but when it came to pub time I was knackered so stayed in.

Sunday - Didn't get up 'til late.  Went to Safeways and got a huge steak. Came home and ate a huge steak. Watched telly then went to the pub for tea. Came home and watched telly all night.

Monday 25th November
Got my office work done, tried to put images on the website but it wouldn't work.  It's so quiet now. I get to spend most of the day in my office if I leave the entry sensor on.  I'm hoping to get loads of work done on the website before Christmas.  Just stayed in and watched telly all night.

Tuesday - Had a bit of a lazy day, then met M and J at the broadband meeting.  The meeting was useless.  Just went round in circles and got no further than the last meeting.  M and J came round after and had a few beers then went to the pub and then had a few more beers with M. Late one.

Wednesday - Got a fried breakfast for me and M from 'Fairlites' in Glenridding then had a really good day putting images on the site.  Made an idiot paper with instructions so I can really crack on with it now.  Took M home, then came back for the football.  Another good result.
Thursday - Got some work done on the website but had a lot of browsers wasting my time.  Just stayed in watching telly.

Friday - More website stuff and totally quiet.  My mate O came round with J and H turned up.  Had quite a riotous night.   W came round as well and  P.  Raided the pub and carried on drinking back here.

Saturday - Got up late feeling well dodgy.  I was going to put the lights up today but there's no way I can handle ladders today.  Just lazed about all day with H, then ripped into town for some beers.  Stopped in watching telly.

Sunday – H went this morning and took [cat] I'm so pleased not to be a cat owner anymore. It'll be easy to keep the house clean now.  Got all the year end finalised and the figures I need at work.  Had a good crack with P and a few customers as well. Stopped in watching TV.

Monday 2nd December
 Got my holiday booked this morning. A week in Italy snowboarding in January.  I'll be away for my birthday so it should be a riot.  Put up the decorations in the shop, then Dad came in the afternoon so I went over to the Inn on the lake and Christmasfied our display windows over there.  Just stopped in watching telly.

Tuesday - Got the torches section on the website finished, except a few of the images don't work so I'll have to redo them.  It's really hard trying to write something original for each torch and giving all the specs, then getting the images right.  Takes ages to do each one.  Paid some bills and did some office work, just stayed in watching telly.

Wednesday - Didn't bother opening today it's that quiet now, I'll start shutting on Wednesdays. Had a really good day tidying up, dusting, hoovering and chipping about the house.  Sorted out the Xmas lights, went into town for spare bulbs, went to Althams and ordered a ladder, they should be delivering tomorrow. Had a hunt for more lights in boxes and found a nice lamp I thought I had lost. Just need a new clamping bit for it - I will get from a car boot sale.  Grafted all day and into the night and then watched telly.

Thursday - All the Direct debit forms are coming through now from starting the Ltd Co.  Spent all day doing them, then stopped in.

Friday - Actually had a few customers today. Spending not just browsing. CB the builder came round after work. He says it's quite an easy job and won't cost too much and can start around Xmas.  I can't wait to go shopping to do out another room.  It's great seeing it come together.  Went to the pub and had a good night. I didn't get too smashed though, as I'm messing about on ladders tomorrow.

Saturday - Got up early and got cracking with the Xmas lights.  I had put up some of the lower ones when I was off on Wednesday and got all the others up this morning before the match.  |It looks ace. The football was excellent, beating Arsenal 2-0 - beauty!  Went into town after the match to get some more lights.  It just needs a little bit more.  Got another rope light, then came home and put it up.  G came round when I was finishing off the lights and stopped for a bit of a crack. Started boozing after all the ladder work was done then went to the pub, L was at the pub so I ended up coming home early with her.

Sunday - Took L home then went to pick my Mum up.  We went to see a beautiful Arts and Crafts house near Newby Bridge called Blackwell. The house is amazing, built at the turn of the century as a holiday home for a brewery boss.  I saw some fireplaces that inspired me, now I know what to do with the scabby fireplace in the living room.
Got a phone call saying Pete's home so headed back but stopped at some old walled gardens on the way back and had a wander round with Mum.  We both have similar taste and enjoy the same things.  Dropped Mum off then came to see wee P and his bird J.  Had a good crack with them and is Mum and Dad then came home for booze and TV. 

Monday 9th December
Came into work full of bounce and ready to do everything. Colin from ‘Gelert’ (outdoor clothing company) called by and I ended up talking to him for an hour, then Geofff from P called by, cracking onto him for an hour.  Mum and Dad invited me out to lunch with my Auntie and cousin.  had a lovely meal and a good crack but I didn't get back to work till 3. It was too late to start anything so I just did a few chores then closed.  Went to Safeways and got loads of stuff then came home.  D came round for a few beers and watched telly.

Tuesday - What a bad start to a day.  Got to work and I had forgotten my zapper for the shutters. Had to come home, then it was so late when I got back to Glenridding, I went to the Doctor's for a flu jab and wrote the morning off. Got opened up and H came by. I wanted a nice dinner today but everywhere was shut. P and J came by and had a good crack, then another day was lost.  Came home and I was meant to go to the Broad band meeting but couldn't be bothered.  Put the fire on and stopped in with telly.

Wednesday - Tidies up the house, washed and hoovered my car and cleaned the windows. I should keep it clean all the time because it looks ace.  W came to pick me up then went down to Manchester for the football. Another 2.0 stuffing of the Spaniards. We are unstoppable.  Came home after 12.

Thursday - Woke up full of cold.  Streaming nose.  There were a few deliveries today so I got those on the computer and put out, had a few customers and closed at 4 because my head was full of snot.  Came home and put the fire on and had a lazy, snotty night.  Pete came round with Jenny but I wasn't up to any partying.

Friday - Had a good day at last getting things done.  Paid bills and went through my to do pile.  [friends] came round, had a few beers then went to the pub.  Not too riotous a night.

Saturday - Watched first half of football winning then went with Carlisle with Martin and Morley.  Went to see [friends] and had a good crack, then had a quick look round Carlisle.  Came back and started boozing and went to the pub.  Quite a late one.

Sunday - Hung over.  Did nothing. (the policeman) came round to congratulate me on my Christmas lights.  Stayed for a bit of crack then I just had a quiet night.

Monday 16th December
Did office work, dead quiet in the shop.  Stayed in watching telly.

Tuesday - met the laddie from HSBC to change the credit card machine over, did a few chores then came home.  Went into Penrith with [friends] and emptied another restaurant - that happens all the time.  Went back to W's for a bit more crack, then home.

Wednesday - Went to Carlisle with J and W and got a lot of Christmas shopping done and met [friends] for lunch.  Came back and went to the pub for Christmas pool. I got knocked out in my first game but stayed all night for the crack. DE won.

Thursday - A bit hungover so I had a lazy day today then went to Carlisle for late night shopping with [friends]. Had a KFC and a mad dash around the shops, got everything now. Came home and watched telly.

Friday - Quiet at work but I got a lot of chores done.  Came home, showered and tuxed up then [friends] picked me up to take me to Glenridding for the Christmas party.  Really good laugh.  Everyone was out, R got steaming, brilliant night, G came out after we'd eaten and she brought me home. 

Saturday - met W at Ingleton and spent the day underground. I loved it!!  I've always wanted to go caving and I wasn't disappointed.  Abseiling, crawling through tunnels and rivers - ace.  Went to a pub for a warming soup and a pint then came home, few beers and pub.  Not too late night.

Sunday - Had a good laugh working with P - not too busy though, stopped in and had a few beers.  [friends] came round for the crack. Watched telly.



Week 48 – Monday 23rd December
Spent all day on the computer with Victoria my accountant.  Got the year end done and Saye sorted out as a limited co.  Good stuff.  Took Richard his presents and the kids, went to Safeways which was full of muppets dithering.  Took Christmas cards round the village, picked up big Al’s beer from the pub, then stayed in, but [friends]  came round.  Had a good laugh.

Tuesday 24th
Morley brought my bike back from the fixers first thing then I came down to work, paid a few bills, said my Merry Christmases and came home early.  Gave D a shout and we took the bikes up on the fells and had a riot.  My bike is running fine, a bit spluttery at first, but then it was flying.  Came back home, got showered, then started partying.  Quite a few folk came round, had beer, went to the pub and stayed there all night.  Always a good night in T.

Weds 25th
Morley woke me up at 10 and wouldn’t let me have more sleep so I got up and felt better than I expected to feel like death but wasn’t too bad.  We had opened a few pressies after the pub last night but once [friends] came round we opened the rest of them and started drinking.  Fine start to the day.  Went to the pub and had a good crack with everyone, then went through for dinner.  The fools had sat us next to the champagne chilling so we drank it all.  Had a huge feast then went back to mine and Morley gave me a stupid Christmas haircut, then played on the bike for a bit, then went round the village visiting folk.  Spent Christmas night having quite a party at  mine, with loads of folk around.  Ace!!

Thurs 26th
Spent the day just watching telly (Muppets and Oliver) with L.  Watched the match and we lost. Pah.  L went about 5 and I just stayed in. Work tomorrow.

Fri 27th
Good day at work, plenty of people about.  We always have Christmas cake and ginger wine on the counter for customers, and it’s really friendly and good fun.  [friends] came round so we ended up getting nailed again, but I passed out earlier and went to bed.

Sat 28th
Came down to work to pick up Mum then went through to Carlisle to look for a kitchen for me. Went round a few places, met some friends for lunch then decided on a really neat, modern one from MFI with 70% off.  Brought Mum back home, met up with Jay, then stayed in planning my new kitchen.

Sun 29th  
Working with P and it’s been busy.  Mum and dad came down for a couple of hours at the end of the day when it got really busy.  Stayed in and made more kitchen plans and watched TV.

This year has been brilliant compared to last year with foot and mouth.  I think if you take something away from people (being aloud to walk in the fells) then they want it more than usual and even people that never used to go walking are interested, probably because of al the media coverage.  People have been asking us all year if we got over F&M and how this year compares. F&M has definitely raised people’s awareness of the countryside and hopefully will make people more respectful of country ways.  We have had our best year ever, but I hope it’s not a one off.  I know people forget very quickly but if the people that got into walking this year enjoyed themselves, then hopefully it will cause more people to try fell walking and in turn bring more people into the Lake District.  Obviously I have selfish reasons for this (I want the shop to get busier and better) but for the whole rural economy to be blossoming is good for the whole country.  And the more money is generated in rural areas, the more the Government has to realise there is life outside the M25 and actually listen to what is needed and will work for the countryside rather than coming up with outlandish schemes based on their own experts’ findings and opinions.  This Gov’t really is an urban government, bringing in schemes that don’t take country life into account and aren’t implementable in rural areas.  Taxing petrol sky high but not improving public transport as an alternative to your own car is a fine example. If anything good can come from F&M, raised awareness that country life is very different from town life and what works for one will not work for the other, would be a step forward.

Week 49 Monday 30th December
Another busy day.  Plenty of folk about.  Went out to the Fox and Pheasant at Armathwaite for a meal with all my old climbing buddies.  The food was beautiful and plenty and really good to see everyone again.  Got a taxi back to T, then went to the pub for more beers, then home to bed.

Tues 31st
Busy again, then home.  C and his wife and kid came round with [friends].  Had a good crack and a bit of a booze then went up to the pub.  All Pete’s family were out and a few fold from town.  Because Martin and K look so good in their fancy dress (Martin as a Medieval  peasant and K a flying cow), I went up in my Elvis suit but had to come home and change after an hour as it gets so sweaty.  Saw in the new Year then went to [friends] who were having a party but it wasn't great and I might have to work tomorrow I came home and was in bed by 4.

Weds 1st
Woke up at 12 and phoned work but Mum said it was quiet and they would ring if they needed me (they didn’t which is nice).  Watched the football, what a cracking match.  Excitement all the way to the end. Didn’t really move too far from the sofa all day.  Good day.

Thurs 2nd
The shop is still busy!  It normally dies after new year’s day but there’s still people here.  Did some office work, served customers and came home for a quiet night by the fire.

Fri 3rd
Busy again but will be different next week I bet.  Mum and Dad came round after work to measure my kitchen properly and make a scale plan, then had some tea and went to the pub.

Sat 4th
Picked up Mum from home then went to Carlisle, had some lunch, then met up with Danny at MFI to plan my kitchen.  It’s going to be ace.  Spent more than I intended (£4500) but I would regret it later if I had cut corners.  Even my tap for the kitchen sink is £200 on its own!!!  God everything ordered and paid a deposit then had a look for carpet for the shop.  Saw some tiles that will work well and got prices on them, then took Mum back to the shop and came home.  Really excited so I had to start boozing early.  [friends] came round and watched telly.

Sun 5th
Working with P today but it’s a lot quieter.  Everyone will be heading home for reality tomorrow.  Just stayed in watching telly.  D came round for a bit, but just a quiet one.





week 50 - Monday 6th January
Back to being dead again, put in some orders to replace stock from over Christmas and make sure everything is sorted for me being away next week. Did some paperwork and came home just stayed in and had a quiet one.

Tuesday
Very quiet, closed early to go to the Low Wood Hotel where Gelert are having a trade show.  Had a good crack with the guys there and made notes on what I wanted to order then came home.  Went to see Pete and Jen, then went to the pub for a few.

Weds
Mum and dad picked me up and we went to Carlisle double checked a few things at MFI and showed dad the kitchen I’ve ordered, showed him the carpet tiles for the shop, and had lunch at the Borderway mart pun.  They brought me home and I went through all the kitchen stuff.  I can’t believe I’m so excited about a kitchen.  I don’t cook and have never been interested before, but I think getting another room in my house to look really smart is brilliant.  Went to town and met mum and Dad at the accounts to go over our year end figures.  Our best year ever, the accountant says I’ve done brilliantly last year.  Went to Safeways then home and stayed in.

Thursday dead again at work.  I phoned double glazing companies and arranged a load of them to come to my house when I’m back from holiday .  Closed quite early and came home, put the fire on and watched telly.

Friday
Quiet again.  I closed for a couple of hours to go to the dentist, clean bill of health, grabbed some stuff from the shop for my holiday and came home.  Finished for over a week.  Ace.  Went to see [friends], then to the pub – didn’t get lashed ‘cause I’ve a lot to do tomorrow.

Sat
Went to Dogs Diner for breakfast, stopped at Penrith motorbikes and got a new helmet and goggles then came home.  Jase came round and had a good crack.  Took down all the Christmas lights off the house and just dumped them in a box, I’ll sort them later.  Went out with D on the motorbikes up Loadpot.  Had a brilliant burn about, loads of snow higher up and really enjoyed getting out.  Came back home then went to Glenridding for the crazy fireworks.  They had been blowing them up all day and had already exploded a tree and caused loads of trouble.  Ace!!  Stayed for a while with the crazy Brummie pyromaniacs then came home to pact.  Got showered and packed then went to P’s as he’s having a 21st birthday party tonight.  Loads of folk there, really good fun and plenty of booze, then came home just after 12 and got the minibus to take us to the airport.

Sunday
Went via Appleby to pick up a weirdo with loads of cats who is also going to the airport.  Really odd fella.  Got to Manchester and waited for ages, got on the plane and flew to Turin, found or bus and drove to Sauze Deux.  The road we went along is the one they filmed the Italian Job on.  It’s ace.  Got to the hotel and had to wait a couple of hours for the rooms so got quite pissed in reception, got the rooms.  Came down for tea got lift passes sorted and then went to the room and died. 

Monday 13th January week 51
Up early for a full day on the slopes.  I thought I would be crap but got on well after shaky start.  Full day duding, brilliant.  Came back to the hotel and chilled for a bit, then went for tea and then to a couple of bars in town.  Smart bar like a cave and the chick there told us what was happening tomorrow night, for my birthday.  Back to the hotel, couple more beers and bed.

Tuesday
Another early start and full day on the hills.  Came back and went to a couple of bars, then supposedly the best restaurant in town, Italian cuisine?  Very average, then another bar for a few then a nightclub with a stripper as a treat for my birthday.  Got so pissed I don’t even remember the stripper or how I got back to the hotel or anything.

Weds
Feel like hell and I’ve really knackered my shin. Slept most of the day but all the others made it out on the slopes.  I would have probably killed myself if I had tried.  Went into town to try some food but that was a struggle to get down, then back to the hotel.  Tried to eat tea at the hotel but that didn’t go down easy so I sacked it and went back to my room.  Feel like death but made good progress with my book.

Thursday
 Alive again!!  Had a good early start and a full day on the slopes. The only problem with this place is the bloody button lifts.  I just can’t do them.  The piste is high and perfect.  Weather couldn’t be better, sunny and blue sky, food is alright and not expensive.  Booze and fags are cheap, the natives are friendly, it’s a great place, but I can’t manage to bloody button lifts on my snowboard.  Anyway chilled for a while when we got back went down for tea, then just carried on reading my book in the room till  fell asleep.

Fri
Another good day out on the slopes.  Best yet.  Conquered the button lifts, spent the day on the Sesturerre side which is brilliant, really feel my boarding is coming on.  Came back, chilled, tea, read and slept.

Sat
Last day boarding, went to the French side, fell off a button lift and got dragged for half a mile.  Made it back to our side for early afternoon then called it a day and went to the pub to watch Man U beat Chelsea 2-1.  Beautiful revenge.  Ha, ha, ha.  Went back to the hotel and read for a bit went for tea then had a really early night.  Home tomorrow, got packed tonight.

Sun
Up at 5 to get to the airport.  Managed to sleep on the coach, checked in at Turin but there is nowhere you can smoke inside the airport.  Feel air rage increasing.  Got on the plane, flew home, got baggage, minibus is waiting for us, and home.  Ace.  Took S to his folks at Askham, met [friends] for one at Queens then came home and unpacked.  Got the fire on and just chilled, [friends] came round about 8, pissed out of their heads but I was too knackered to play.  Just went to bed.

Monday 20th January week 52
CB, the guy who is doing all my building work round first thing to say he can start this week so I took the day off work and spent all day emptying the sheds and the kitchen and filling a skip and moving all my firewood.  I’m knackered.  D came round after I had emptied the kitchen and bought a great big sledge hammer with him.  We had a few beers then destroyed the kitchen units and knocked a hole in the wall just for fun.  Ace.

Tuesday 
Back to work today with a pile of stuff to sort out.  Spent all day just working through ‘in’ pile.  Made good progress.  [friends] came round and invited me to theirs for tea.  Seeing as I don’t have a kitchen anymore this seemed like a good idea.  Had a lovely curry, then came down to mine for some beers. J came round about midnight and stopped for a couple of hours for crack.

Weds
I had arranged for a load of double glazing salesmen to come round today to get quotes.  I went into town this morning and my car died. So I took it to the garage and left it and C came and fetched me home.  There’s no heating as they are moving the boiler so I stayed by the fire in the living room all day with hellish noises coming from the destroyed kitchen area, listening to one double glazing salesman after another until I didn’t care anymore.  L came out to see me for a while then when the last salesman had gone she took me to the off licence and the chippy and dropped me off at home.  Morley and Jase came round for the football, little Scholles, what a beauty he’s being this season.  Beat Blackburn to make the final at the worthless cup.  Few beers and a good result.

Thursday Dad picked me up and took me to work.  Spent the day catching up still, Mum and Dad came and we went to Langdale Hotel to a trade show.  Stayed for a while and got everything I wanted done, then came back and I pinched Mum’s car for a couple of days.  I’m full of cold so just wanted to get home by the fire.  Stayed in sneezing and snotting.

Fri
Full of snot and catching up on paper work.  I’m almost sorted now just a few more things to do tomorrow.  This week I’ve been so quiet I haven’t bothered to cash up on a night just did all week’s tonight.  Picked up Dad on my way to town so he cold bring Mum’s car home when I get mine back but it’s not right so the garage have lent me a Toyota Starlet. Last time I was in one of those we crashed into someone’s bathroom and wrote it off.  Went to pick up Morley and had a few beers, then [friends]  came round and just stayed in cracking.

Came home and had tea, then went to the pub to meet the guys from the trade show because they are stopping at the Queens (local pub).  Had a good crack with them.

 Busier today.  Cracking day selling lots of everything. This year has started even better than last year, which was our best ever. With War looming I think people will holiday in this country and we should be in for another brilliant year. All the signs are pointing that way, let’s just hope nothing screws it up.

Got all my jobs done and away by 4. Got the tent and everything packed into Morley’s van and set off to Keswick. Put the tent up then went for an hour’s free boozing. Got very drunk then went into Keswick. Had jam roly poly somewhere, don’t remember anything else.

Fri
Beer for breakfast then into Keswick.  Met C in town then me, Morley, D and C just drank in beer gardens all afternoon.  The festival started at 6 so went back t the site (we are the only people camping on the festival site, cool) and carried on getting drunk, saw loads of friends and people I hadn’t seen for ages, had a few goes on the bungey trampolines and an ace night. Sung with Abba on stage.

Sat
Beer for breakfast and straight back to it.  Lying in the sun all day with friends and drinking beer. Doesn’t get much better than this.  When we went back to the tent, C came over with her friends, then passed out and stayed in the tent with me resulting in a cold, bad night’s sleep for me.

Sun
Got the tent down and set off home 5 minutes before it started chucking down.  Got home and emptied the van then watched telly all afternoon, went to the pub for a couple then home for a quiet night.  Cooked tea and went to bed.


Week 72 – 9th June
Quiet today, put in some orders and paid some bills.  Went to Safeways with D, then tidied the house up a bit and watched telly.

Tuesday
Quite busy, had to go to P to meet the lady from ADT for the security tags. Went through things with Geoff for a while then back to work.  Washed and hovered my car, cleaned the wheels and windows and it’s looking good. With taking over the shop at P I really can’t afford a new car this year so I’ll make the most of what I’ve got.

Weds
Quiet today, did some office work, not a lot to do.  Morley and D came round for the football.  Bad match but good result. Went to the pub for a couple then home.

Thursday Quiet again. Had a sort out in my office, threw loads of stuff out.  Made some space which is nice.  J and C came round for a few beers and fetched a curry.  Good crack.

Fri
Put a final coat of paint on the kitchen  n the morning.  Went out on my bike to Howtown after dinner at the pub. Went for 21st in town with Morley and Jako. Got leathered and had a riot.  Don’t know how I got home but I woke up in my bed alone, which is nice.

Sat
Had a good lie in, Doug’s for breakfast then biked down to P for a few beers with D.  Stopped at the Queens for a couple on the way back, then stopped in watching telly.



Sun
Working with P and Marion which is always good fun. Quite busy and a good crowd of customers today.  Came home and had a few beers in the garden with the boys.  Came in. watched TV.

Reflection on last 18 months   
The last year and a half have been brilliant. Work is going really well. Foot and mouth, with the fells closing and all the publicity it got, seemed to remind people about the great outdoors and the shop has never been busier.  I’m getting better at my job as well.  More precise with my ordering and putting good ranges of clothing and boots together.

Taking over the shop at P is really exciting.  I think I can turn that into a little gold mine. It’s the perfect location and I’m sure doing more walking gear and fashion will do far bet than chandlery is, I think I’m going to be quite a wealthy boy in a few years.

Where work is getting better and better so is my private life. I have so much fun on evenings and my days off with my mates.  We have a riot all the time. Doing stupid things and having adventures.  Not having a girlfriend really is a license to have fun.  No ear bending and whingeing.  Life is good.

I wonder if you can you talk me through some of the events of last year

It was quite a strange year.  I had just come back from working in the Scotland/NorthEast region, Newcastle, they had got us over there following the October floods in 2000.  It was only about the end of January/February that I actually returned to the office and it seemed to me as soon as we got there that the foot and mouth outbreak kicked off.  

Initially there wasn’t a great deal of involvement other than plotting where things were developing and, working in the flood defence department, we didn’t get that involved but it became apparent that they needed our expertise on information systems and so quite a lot of people in the department were initially involved in using maps and where outbreaks where occurring.  

Then DEFRA came forward and asked for volunteers to go as gatekeepers.  So really without thinking I got involved because I like being outside more than in the office to a general degree I put my name forward.  So we were invited to a briefing which took place here at the agency.  It lasted about an hour, then virtually a brief explanation by people from MAFF (at the time) what the job involved which seemed to be just standing at the gate issuing licences and other paperwork.  Then we were whisked off to Rose Hill, given some equipment and told to ring the vet the following day and you will be assigned to your first farm. 

When was this, sorry?

It would be towards the end of February, about the same time now. 

So, quite soon after the outbreak occurred?

Yes, it wasn’t too long after the outbreak occurred.  So I rang the vet up, he was a very young lad; he wasn’t from this area.  The first job was a farm at Osrigg on the fell side of Cumbria.  It turned out to be somebody’s farm I knew.  I spent a lot of time in childhood my in that area.

Did that make it easier or more difficult?

I think it made it easier because I got all over the place.  Initially when I turned up I didn’t know what they were going to do so I stood on the gate and then the vet came down from the farm and said you are not doing anything here I need your help up at the farm and so we just got involved helping the slaughter team and the vet.  Initially I was standing at the gate doing nothing whatsoever.

What did you think about that at the time?

Well, we probably did more good helping out.   They didn’t give any concern regarding their own health and safety.  I think the events just took over and you just did what you could to help at the time.

There was no sign of a field officer from MAFF at the time.  I didn’t see one for at least a week and half to two weeks after that.  So virtually you were acting as a link between the farmer.  They were desperate for information from MAFF and I spent a lot of fruitless time on the phone trying to get information on their behalf.  Managed to push things through by ringing our own incident room, which was then operating down here.  I think one of the initial things we found out is it is very difficult obtaining information.  The farmers couldn’t sort of use the representative from the government at the time; myself and the vet were kind of burdened with it all.

That must have been quite stressful.

Yes it was frustrating as well because I couldn’t find anything out from them and then you could see they were getting frustrated they could take it out on me.   I was amazed by how they handled it themselves.  I mean they had the right I could drive away and go home for a short time but they had to live with it.

How much did your experiences in those first few days match the job description that MAFF give you? 

Well it didn’t really match it at all.  We did issue licences to the farmers and their families but, because nothing was decided regarding disposal at that time – I mean the stock was lying about dead for days. 

I had a problem because this farmer had two satellite farms as well which I had also to go and look at.  That meant constantly disinfecting my vehicle, myself and then coming to and fro.  Unfortunately one of the smallholdings was like a barn complex right smack in the middle of Normanton village right amongst some houses and next to the pub and there was slaughtered stock lying about there and nobody seemed to be able to move it. 

It must have been very frustrating.

Very frustrating, yes, trying to get people to come and look at the problem and get somebody there.  I was actually badgering people here and badgering people up at Rose Hill trying to do something about it.     

So from that first day, how did events unfold?

Well, the first week was pretty much the same, quite traumatic, because nothing was happening on my farm I got sent to other farms and we just ended up doing the same thing, helping the slaughter teams.  I mean the difficult thing was the real intention was just to stay on that gate but that just wasn’t possible because of the spreading outbreaks developing so that was … it was a relief to hear that the army was eventually to be called in but we knew that would take some time to organise and there seemed to be a gap unfortunately between the farms that the army was assigned to and the ones that MAFF was supposed to be dealing with initially and a number of farms just seemed to be forgotten - regarding disposal.   A lot of time I think our field officer told us that we had to get on the phone and try and get things moving.  We were virtually acting as field officers rather than gatekeepers.

Right, it certainly sounds like that.

Certainly when the army first got involved they were sending a NCO or corporal to the farms.  The first ones I met wouldn’t go near the stock at all.  Their orders were not to so they stood on the gates while we helped the slaughter team and the vets. I never want to see it again, but at the time we were just doing what we could to help people.  I never had any animosity from them, from the farming community whatsoever.  They were fantastic to me.   I think it helped maybe being a local lad.  I think most of the farmers, the majority of farmers I went to, I actually knew - that certainly helped me.

Do you think it was good for them to see a familiar face?

Yes, it is difficult to think what to say to them really.  I mean they could have been really nasty – they could sort of see me as sort of being DEFRA or the government, an arm of government but for some reason I never faced that at all.  I never encountered any animosity at all, all the time.

What about the way the slaughter teams were operating?

Things were pretty good the only problem is that they had so many jobs they were running out of overalls.  I had to be quite strict with them regarding disinfectant.  Certainly it was a worry for me that that weren’t taking enough time over disinfecting - they were just keen to get onto the next job or they had so many jobs to do a day and they had to forfil the quota.  It certainly concerned me when a slaughter team that worked on an farm went to a disposal site where then went onto another farm, there was quite a big risk. I annoyed them quite a bit by making them disinfect all the army vehicles.  Luckily they were local people from the Penrith area so I knew most of them myself.  So they did actually listen to me in the end and then they were quite pleased because I had a number of spare disposable overalls to issue for the next job, because they had run out.  

We were very lucky at the agency, staff  here were very supportive to us outside and kept phoning to see how we were getting on and also they were delivering.  They set up a supply system and they delivered supplies of overalls, disinfectant.  At the time even the farmers were borrowing stuff off us because they couldn’t get hold of what they needed.

Why do you think you think the Environment Agency could do that and DEFRA couldn’t?

Well we didn’t have as many personnel …  DEFRA had the supply depot at Rose Hill, we actually had staff and vehicles going out delivering this actually to people on – not on site but just off site.  They were dropping off off-site and we were going down and picking it up.

It sounds like very quickly the Environment Agency set up the logistic or systems to get deliveries going…

We had sort of experience of doing that in my department.  It was mainly from defence protection, running a network for an emergency workforce.  Because they couldn’t do any ongoing flood defence work or maintenance work they were being seconded onto this job and they were also helping with disinfecting.  So we had a support base.  We set up our own incident room even before the army set up theirs at Rose Hill.  

I mean that was a major problem was lack of army staff, there didn’t seem to be any central co-ordination.  We saw people in emergency planning working close to 18 hours.  I was quite taken aback at the lack of forethought or lessons learnt from ‘67.  I was quite dismayed how slowly the reaction was to get the army in.  The initial reaction when it took of in this county to get the army in as soon as possible. It seemed to take a long time.  I know there had been logistical problems arranging it all.

Do you think there any resistance to the army becoming involved on the part of DEFRA?

Because I was out there I was really unable to gauge that.  I am sure the brigadier, having met him, wouldn’t have been afraid of stepping on people toes, I am sure he wasn’t but I think it needed that.  I think getting all the agencies together in one building and certainly having an operations room was a must.

Did you see Countryfile on Sunday?

No, not…

Birtwhistle was being interviewed, apparently he is writing a book.

I am not surprised.  I saw he was on the TV the other night I can’t remember what - with Prince Charles.

So how long where you doing this job?

I would be out on the farm just over a month before I got pulled off. 

So about a month?

I finished on a Church of England one, a tenant farmer.  Out towards Carlisle, about two miles outside Carlisle, quite a small farm.  I had a lot of empathy with them, it was a lad working there of about of 37 and he had lost his parents, he had lost a dairy herd, it was awful.  He also gone through a similar situation to myself when my marriage broke up.  He had split with his wife but she had come back to help on the farm and got stuck on there with the foot and mouth so they had the additional problem of living in the same house through all that as well.  I used to sit and talk to them and help out as much as I could on the farm, take supplies out.  You did get personally involved you couldn’t avoid it.

Yes, it must have been very difficult not to.

It was hard to... you were professional but it was hard to stand back and not be affected by what you saw and certainly on that farm that affected me most of all.  He had gone through the situation I had gone through. I really felt for him and I felt like keeping in touch with him at times.  I feel I should got back, you feel that you should go back and visit these people to see how they are getting on know but you can’t get too involved, they have their own lives to get on with.

I guess it would be good to know whether he was restocking or…

Well, talking to you I don’t think he had any other intention but to restock. He used to say to me about the dairy herd.  They got infected, there was no … he realised there was no alternative to slaughter.  He said he missed the grumpy ones the worst because they are the ones - the prickly characters -because they are the ones that cause him all the problems when he was milking and that.  A dairy herd they have each got their own characteristics, each cow.  So that is why we had problems with that farm.  Limousin bulls - he had some beef cattle as well, Limousins, they jumped out of pens, chaotic, we couldn’t contain them. 

Just when they were about to be culled?

We had a very young field officer from DEFRA at the time but we had the army as well. By that time we were working with Field Officers the organisation was a lot of better, the disposal was a lot quicker.  

At that time I got pulled out and then I went to work on a landfill site, Hespin Wood, really testing work.

Could you describe a typical day for me when you were working for DEFRA?

It just varied.  It just depended what type of site what the disposal was going to be.  On the burns site you were working from first light in the morning till it got dark basically and then sometimes after dark as long as it didn’t get too dangerous.  A lot of problems were the access roads were very narrow for articulated wagons. When I sat down and thought why they had been pulled me off I could appreciate that we weren’t doing what job we were possibly intended to do.   I mean towards the end of it we were standing on gates and issuing licences and paperwork and directing.   It was very difficult standing on a these gates trying to issue licences in the rain, to keep all your paperwork dry.

How did you feel when you were pulled off? 

I felt very angry about it at the time.  But after it had all finished I came back to the office and sat down and really thought about it I could understand why we were pulled.  But I think I would have preferred it if the agency involved us as Field Officers in the first place.

Why were you angry?

You just felt like you were doing something useful out there you were helping, very little but you were providing a certain amount of support.  But I felt we were doing a decent job.  I felt a lot of the lads and the ladies who were appointed gatekeepers especially from the agency were capable of being field officers on a farm.  Some of the younger people they brought in from various parts of DEFRA were immediately promoted to field officers, shipped up to Cumbria and out onto the farms.   I felt we had the experience in the agency to do the job just as well as they did.

What was it like working on the disposal site? 

I didn’t enjoy it all.  It was just shift work basically.  A lot of it was you were logging the vehicles in and out, issuing licences.  Initially it was a bit more involved because we were actually supervising the disinfecting work.  They had various commercial people round making sure we were doing the job proper.  I had two gangs from Liverpool who were from the high-pressure disinfectant company.   The humour from them lads kept me going, they were amazing. 

Scouse humour is quite notorious.

Yes, the talk used to be not about the job you were doing but about other things really it took your mind off it.  I was amazed what they could eat while they were carrying on with this work.  I didn’t enjoy it.

I guess it must have been a very unpleasant job

Initially you were dealing with suspicion because they though you were the spy in the cab, keeping tabs on them, what they do.  I found them very professional, unbelievably so.  They did take pride it what they did. Most of the time it was cold and wet and miserable,  the Environment Agency they did something about that in the end.  When previously we were doing the gatekeeping they actually managed to find more caravans so people could kip down, there somewhere dry to dry off, have some lunch, get away from it, get a hot drink.

Did you get a full supply of clothing…waterproofs?

DEFRA yes, originally gave us an issue.  I did go back to the depot and got clean ones, got another issue.   It was probably the district council was running the supplies by then I think the other guy had gone off with stress by then so I got whatever I wanted, it was somebody I knew.

On going back to Rose Hill on the second occasion which was towards the time when they came to the end of the outbreak, the organisation, the personnel and the set up there was vastly changed.

Was it?  It’s amazing the camaraderie that can sometimes exist in these sorts of situations…

It is amazing how people pull together. I mean it has affected us all.  It has affected me. Even my sport, I play rugby and all the fixtures were cancelled.  Things got worse for the club, the club even got relegated because of foot of mouth because they couldn’t fulfil some of the fixtures. 

That’s outrageous…

They even appealed to the RFU and the local MP got involved but we got relegated.  It had an impact right through the community. They based the calculation on the past results. Somebody had to be relegated we suffered the consequences.

What was it like when you saw the disposal site for the first time?

Quite amazing really, I saw carcasses I saw outside the grounds. I think it was the animal equivalent of what we had seen in the concentration camps during the war.  These huge pits and the smell and you never get used to that smell.  I mean sometimes it wasn’t so bad if you fresh carcasses coming in but the ones that had been laying about a long time the whole scale of the thing.

Did you find that you get used to it?

Well you do get used to .. well the landfill site I never did get used to the smell.   I thought it was such a waste… I  maybe don’t subscribe to all the conspiracy theories.

There were an awful lot knocking around.

There was lot of rumourmongers going on, about changing the nature of farming.  I don’t really subscribe to the conspiracy theory.  It worries me because I am local, I was born in Penrith.  Very proud of Cumbria. [Tape inaudible]  I am very proud of being a northerner but not excessively.   I just felt we felt neglected and the lack of information was very frustrating in addition to the lack of organisation, the lack of any  planning - contingency planning.

That must have been very frustrating for you, given your background?

I had 18 years of planning in a very disciplined organisation (the Police). It just felt like it was a shambles to be honest that is what it felt like to me.  There didn’t seem to be any direction.  It was all reaction to what was happening. There didn’t seem to be any plan as to how to get on top of the problem.  I think a lot of people felt that the Brigadier was the man who got on top of it.

So how long did you work in the disposal site?

It would be about another month or so.  Then I got a phone call from the boss he said I think you have been out there long enough, come back in.

What did you think of that?

I had been on disposal site.  I wasn’t doing much.  I didn’t see why the weighbridge couldn’t log in log in the vehicles, issue the licences because they were better organised by then.  The disinfectant process was well organised by then: they had sprays on the gates and everything the wagons were cleaned down before they came on site and went through a wash system.  Everything was running smoothly by then.  I was very impressed by the company who run waste management, I had nothing but praise for the assistance they gave us.  I know we have had our run-ins with them in the past but they were all right pollution officers had problems in Cumbria at times but at the time we forget about all the differences and got on with the job.  I mean they were working very long hours, longer hours than we were.

So at the end of this two-month period, how did you feel?

Very tired.  The best thing, I was lucky in a way because I was allowed to clean up and come off a couple of times during this and I was able to get away and see my children and I had a break and they took my mind of it for a short time.  But even when I came back I never got away from it.  Well I was working weekends as well.  I was working four days on and four off, 7 to 7, That was quite a tasking job as well because you were remote from the situation but you were liasing with all the agencies involved, processing a hell of a lot of paper. Looking at requests, things like that, there was also stuff coming in from Head Office and from the national survey so it was answering those queries as well. We learned a lot more about the [Environnment]Agency and different things working in the agency.  I met a lot more people in the agency working across teams.  There were them sort of benefits as well came out.

There seemed to be a popular theory that things changed when the Army became involved.

I think the impression was given that ooh the army is here now it is going to get better but it took a while for their sort of logistics to kick in.

What was it like when you were eventually went back to your proper job?

Very difficult, I had real problems coping with going back to the day job.  Everything had just gone.  Nobody was able to do my day job for me, this thing impacted on a small office, even people who stayed in the office the whole time. I am still feeling the consequences of foot and mouth in that respect.

You must have lost months of data?

Well, it is not bad, things like rainfall data we can get, it is not that bad, luckily we didn’t have any major flooding at the same time, which would have been bad.

It must have affected licences and that sort of thing

Yes water resources… but they were heavily involved in ground water assessment and things like that, disinfecting lagoon construction

So for a lot of people in the Agency, their day jobs went out of the window.

Changed dramatically.  And I felt great I had great difficult in adjusting back to my job.  I had been away from the job for six month working in Newcastle and then gone out on the foot and mouth and I got a need for being outside I preferred being out.  It is taking a long time to adjust to being in an office all the time.

How have you handled that?

Well I still felt I struggled with it but I have talked it over with the bosses and they keep telling me I am doing a good job and somehow I don’t feel I am operating on the same level I was when I first started. It is difficult sometimes when you have gone through something like foot and mouth to look at flooding in the same way.  You know although I have seen some terrible effects of flooding the effects can be terrible and traumatic as well but I have never seen anything to touch what people have gone through (FMD).

Do you think the whole thing has changed the way you value things, situations?

Yes, when you have seen what people have gone through out there you start questioning your job really what you are trying to achieve.  I mean I am getting back to where I was, I hope.

Do you think your experiences are typical of others in the Agency?  

We did have a debrief specially for all the people who were involved in foot and mouth and even people who just stayed in the office but worked on things associated with foot and mouth there was a lot of discussion.  It was quite a heavy session a lot of views were aired.  I know B who was also on the panel he had got very strong views.  I could see where he was coming from and he thinks there was some sort of conspiracy which is for somebody working for the Government I don’t know if it is a brave view but certainly his arguments put forward were very convincing.  You can’t ignore them.

Was it useful having that debriefing session?

Very, we were offered counselling and certainly at the time because of problems with my marriage breakdown and thing like that maybe I think I should go for counselling but I don’t think I need counselling for foot and mouth despite the gruesome things I saw.  I never want to see them again, put it that way but I felt I was able to cope with them. My view on it was more that people are out there on the farms were in a lot worse position than I am and they don’t have counselling.  They had slaughtered stock lying about the farmyard, but I had to come off sometime.   I felt for them more than I felt for myself.

What about now, do you get any flashbacks or bad memories around the events of last year?

No I don’t really get nightmares not now I think I did at the time.  I think some nights you came home you would switch the TV on and you couldn’t get away from it and you went to bed and it was still spinning round in your head and you became a bit of a automaton.  You would get up in the morning you got your kit together and got out and even when you came home at night I used to disinfect and shampoo everything I had on.   I mean you didn’t want to go anywhere, you kept yourself to yourself you didn’t want to spread.   I dreaded the thought of spreading the disease or anything like that because I saw these different cattle and sheep especially cattle, so I was maybe over the top.  I think I ruined the car I had to get it re-polished, professionally polished because it had been pressure washed that many times.

How often does it come into you mind now?

It is never away, it is always in the news in Cumbria, all the time.  I would read the evening paper when I got home and there used to be pages of it at one time.  It is in just now and again now but it is still there.

I guess the whole of your life was affected as well, your social life?

Yes, it was to a certain extent.  I was lucky, my parents, I was living with my parents at the time but they were in Portugal for a month.  They went away before I went out, so when they came back it was like a war zone to them.  They had seen it on the TV but they couldn’t believe it. When I was up at Ousby, because it was up on a height looking down the Eden valley.  I can remember standing at night looking down the valley and it looked like a scene I had seen from Kuwait during the Gulf War with all the pyres burning   It reminded me of all the oil wells on fire in Kuwait, it was really surreal.  I used to drive back home through the Eden valley, driving through smoke.

It must have been so strange.

Yes it was a very unreal experience that was.  My friend has got a big farm down at Eden Hall, he has got a fishery as well.  And as I was driving down the road there was a huge pyre there and piled up with soot. It was absolutely huge, I couldn’t believe it and you couldn’t see on the road you had to have the lights on - day turned to night, I couldn’t believe it happened.

Do you think these experiences have affected your health in any way?

I don’t think so.  I mean I worried about all these different disinfectants they were using and what was the affect on myself and on the land and whatever.  You throw disinfectant at everything yes I suppose you tried to contain it and make sure it didn’t spread.  But I suppose you did get worried then there was all these rumours about you could catch it yourself and going in and spraying down slaughtered stock to try and stop it.  That was the only thing you could do for the farmers was try to get the smell down essentially go and spray but you tried to take as many precautions: you wore mask and goggles.  I shaved my moustache off actually and never grew it back again because I was wearing a mask all the time.  It made a better seal, the moustache got in the way so that came off.  I had had that moustache for years so it changed the way I looked.

I can’t fault the Agency for the support we got when we were out there and even afterwards the management, especially my Department, manager.  People like Bob R and arranged all the supplies, and organised the rota were fantastic.  And even just people I worked with just ringing up, that phone call, your mobile phone was the only way to the office because you couldn’t come into the office.  If you had to come and see somebody you could only come to the top of the car park full of disinfectant.  You had to hand things over in plastic bags and all sorts.  It was a strange experience.

You carried your phone around in a plastic bag and things like that.  Everything was in a plastic bag.  And you were worried about these health implications.  You thought, “ am I taking the right precautions” and you were worried it would affect you.

Were you surprised about the impact foot and mouth had on the county?

I had heard people talk about what it was like in 1967.  My parents - my mother worked on Newton Riggs on the farms at the agricultural college and she worked there a long time before she retired and she can remember things like that.  I talked to them when the outbreak first broke out.  It didn’t hit Cumbria too bad in 1967.   I think in 1958 - some of the older farmers used to tell me ohh in 1958 we just dug a hole, chuck them in the ground and chucked quick lime on it.  It was difficult to explain to them the world had changed, legislation had changed and they just couldn’t do that any more.  And they said well why not this is the quickest way to get rid of it and as far as you can actual.  There was some criticism of the agency when they took a long time to turn round these request but the people on the office were working full time on it most requests were being assessed and turned round in 48 hours.  They did a fantastic job especially considering the groundwork regulations they had to look at.

And then the stories about pyres spreading the disease, things like that.  the cost of them was absolutely frightening.  Where things where coming from spreading - we had these huge lorries we had to make sure were disinfected properly coming from Inverness with timber coal. It was   frightening really to see them come down these tiny country roads.  Contractors had to make temporary roads to get these vehicles into some of these places because they were up to their axles, they had to drag them out.  There was roadstone coming in from Shap quarries by the wagonful to establish roads they had to lay a road to get to the fire site virtually and even then they got bogged down.  

That must have been a massive logistical exercise?

Yes it was.  Initially it was just chaotic.  I mean luckily where I was working the contractors were local and some I knew and they were very good and they knew the farmer as well so there was no problem whatsoever they tried to help them as much as possible.

What was the worse part about last year for you?

Just the sheer waste, all the dead animals really.  I don’t like to see animals suffer at all.  I mean they didn’t suffer where we where anyway.  I think the vets generally the vets I saw were very professional. The slaughter teams I think most of them, the ones I met anywhere were fairly professional.  It was just - the pregnant ewes were worst, I think, that was dreadful.  We had to slaughter - there were 2000 sheep on one of the places we where and a lot of the ewes were pregnant and as they were being slaughtered they were having premature births and I wasn’t physically sick or anything but you felt you were going to be but you knew you had to get the job done and get on with it.   I saw a lad that got his dairy herd slaughtered, he stood there you should have seen his face   It just seemed such a waste.  I know stock gets slaughtered, we eat it, a lot of farm animals get slaughtered every year normally anyway - but not on that scale.  

The whole context changed.

Yes, definitely.

Can you see anything good that came out of last year?

Actually, to be fair, it may sound strange but I actually felt worthwhile being out there, I felt I was doing a worthwhile job, I got a lot out of that.  I got a lot of strength from people out there the farmers themselves, and their wives and the way they were facing things.

Have you been in touch with any of the farmers?

No, it has been a bit difficult.  I felt like ringing them up and saying how are you getting on and things like that but I would rather bump into them and speak to them face to face and then you just feel like you are intruding.  It is difficult.  I mean I got to know a lot of people.  

We had one farm where there were 20 houses.  They had built a housing estate on the farm as well, of private houses, so they were all stuck on there for two weeks as well or they had to actually leave their houses and live off site.  It had a huge impact on them as well, their jobs.  They were working in town or Carlisle working on newspapers. It had a massive impact in the county.

Is there anything I haven’t asked you that you think is important?

No, I just think what we were trying to achieve was worthwhile, especially if it goes back to government.  I think the social issues tend to get in the road.  It is something that does need research I mean speaking myself about flooding I know how traumatic flooding can be to people who suffer flooding, flooded out of their houses virtually destroyed by flood water, it is a really traumatic experience. Certainly within the agency with flood warning it is one thing that we are looking more and more at the social consequences of flooding and trying to get people to react better to flood warnings to take flood warnings on board and actually do something.

The way Defra managed things, do you thing they thought about the social effects of culling?

Like I said for most farmers it was a traumatic experience seeing their stock slaughtered.  A lot of them couldn’t face seeing it I know some camped out for the night but most farmers on the farms I was on were actually involved in helping to slaughter the stock, They wanted the team to work with them. They felt the need to be there they wanted to make sure things were done correctly 

Do you think there was any recognition of the impact of culling on the farmer and the farmer’s family? It didn’t seem to be part of anybody’s thinking really.

No it wasn’t really it was just such a rush job it was just in, get them killed and lay them out as best you could for when disposal was going to occur but we couldn’t even tell them when disposal was going to occur at first and that was terrible and then they were lying about for days.  That was the worse thing seeing them laying about there.  I can’t imagine what that was like.

I arrived at A's house shortly before six in the evening as arranged.  I met his 2.5 year old daughter M, and his wife in their small hallway.  9 month old baby J was happily kicking his legs in his bouncy chair in the living room just off to the right, which was full of colourful toys.  The TV was playing.  A's wife greeted me warmly and retreated back into the kitchen to the left of the hallway.  A ushered me into the dining room adjacent to the kitchen.  M protested loudly, clinging on to A's legs with heartfelt cries of 'Daddy, Daddy' .  Mum swept M up and A and I settled around a large wooden table by a bay window, ""still haven't got curtains in here so hope it's not too cold.""  A was not fazed by the tape recorder and throughout the early part of the  interview, M protested at the absence of her father.  A remained unperturbed.

Tell me a bit about your background?
I’m 37 years of age.  I was brought up in the Cockermouth area, in a hill farming area although my parents aren’t farmers, but my grandfather was a farmer on my mother’s side and that’s where my interest in the farming side came.  I use to go to Ulverston auctions as a child, and with my father's and grandfather's grace I used to sit up alongside an auctioneer so it’s always been in the back of my mind.  So I left school and went to the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester to train as a Land Agent, because I decided at that stage that I wanted to work in the farming community.  When I came out of college I came back to Cumbria to work in the Penrith Auctions as a trainee Land Agent, and then came an opportunity to do some auctioneering, which I took to very quickly. I decided that once I was a qualified Land Agent and Chartered Surveyor, I would want to specialise in auctioneering.  I continued with my training there until 1994, and then my old home town, which was Cockermouth, offered me a post there which very quickly led to a managerial role, and I’ve worked very hard over the last few years.  Pretty soon I was to be working for a new market development which was very much on the cards when I went, and then it was put on hold because of BSE and the awful problems with the stock trade which collapsed.  Then we thought we had just got things going again, prices were picking up, and the financial side of things were right, then in February last year  [PAUSE]    on the day of our last  [EMPHASIS HERE] market, in the old market, we went to our share holders that night [EMPHASIS HERE]        with a big presentation saying we were going ahead with the auction, and within a week it was on hold because of foot and mouth.

Personally, my wife P, we have been married for 4 years now, but been together about 10 or 11 years,  we have a little girl who’s screaming like mad in the background, can you hear her? 

Yes.   I was going to say, if she needs you because..   

No, she’s 2.5 years old and the little boy L who’s 9 month, and he was born just in the middle of foot and mouth which was not a very pleasant affair.  That’s about it really.  Hobby -wise I’ve always played rugby, to a fairly decent standard. Played in the national leagues and only just recently retired, and not through choice really.  At my age the old aches and pains get you, so I was a bit reluctant at times but I’d still love to be playing really.   To replace that [EMPHASIS],   a friend of mine who I played rugby with also played in a band, and I was already known for my singing in the back of the bus [laughs], so he persuaded me to go along one night with his band and have a sing song, which is something I’d never done before and I ended up staying with them. Then I met the man who played the saxophone and knew a man who played the trumpet and all of a sudden we had ourselves a soul band in the brass section.  That kind of spiralled as a hobby to the point where we started taking bookings and that sort of turned into my major hobby.  At the moment we play about once a fortnight, we don’t push it, we’re all professionals and we’re all in jobs so it’s just a hobby, we go out and we sing and do a lot of weddings and that type of thing.  

You’ve given me a complete potted history, so I’m going to have to unravel things. [LAUGHS]  Going back to your farming roots, your Grandfather who farmed, do you have any stories about the 1967/68 foot and mouth outbreak?

Never ever [EMPHASIS] remember it being discussed.  To my knowledge it wasn’t prevalent in Cumbria anyway, I’ve heard stories from local farmers in the Cockermouth area and things, but that was never discussed.  I mean here it started at that time with the beef cattle and the  [INAUDIBLE] sheep, I was only 2 at the time so I don’t remember that, It just came as an absolute shock really.  

So this outbreak, have you heard stories about the 67/68 outbreak, have there been any comparisons?

 Yes there have, most of those I’ve heard from people like vets who were involved at that time and it gets past on to other vets.

  
Are there any sort of general trends that you think might be relevant?  

Yes, very much so, I mean the vets that were involved at the time are astounded that a lot of the recommendations that were made from the final report in 67 were not adhered to.  In other words, to always have a strategy to tackle the disease if it was here, goes on from there.  

So In terms of where you live, your background, and as a live stock manager, what is your first memory of this foot and mouth outbreak?  

           My first memory was on, it was [PAUSE]   I think it was on Wednesday the 21st of February.  

So you can date it.  

I can date it. We were outside, I was in the box, [at the Auction Mart] we were outside, I was selling sheep, they were the dearest prices they had been for 3 or 4 years and we had a market full of sheep. On the up, things were looking great, and we were looking that night to go to our share holders with a full package, for the new market development [for a new Auction site] to say they were going to go ahead, and approximately 2pm in the afternoon the values were totally flat on the stock pit. I said to one of the guys, what the hell is going on, and he said this foot and mouth had hit, and I swore at him and told him not to take the Michael, and he said, no it’s true.   I said to the guys what do you want me to do, do you want me to stop selling the stockpile now or do you want me to keep going?  All of them said keep going we are trying to make some phone calls to find out what our [EMPHASIS] instructions are and so we carried on, and the trade price had dropped by 6,7,8 pounds per head at that stage, we were still selling [EMPHASIS]      them but at much reduced price.  A lot of farmers decided they didn’t want to sell them at that, and they would take them home and bring them back next week, and with hindsight I think selling them was the worse thing we ever did.  Gradually the calls came through for the buyers to keep on buying although the trade didn’t ever get back to the prices that it was.  With hindsight at that point, then they should have stopped everything, stopped all our movements, that was on the Wednesday and they didn’t do that until the Friday night at 5pm. 

So farmers were actually still taking their stock away?

Sure.
          
 So how far did they travel? 

Oh all over the country.  Our sheep go all over the country.  See, our friends at Longtown market, the day after, they carried on trading as normal.  Their stock went all over the country and the government didn’t stop the animals moving until 5pm Friday night, it was crazy [EMPHASIS]. That’s the biggest [EMPHASIS]      mistake they made. They let us down really bad.  I really [EMPHASIS]  feel quite resentful for that, they really let us down.

At that point what was your understanding of foot and mouth?   
           
           I’ve no knowledge at all [EMPHASIS],     It was a disease which I knew spread ferociously, if that’s the right word, that’s the sum total of my knowledge.  I actually said that the meeting that we had with our share holders, the last comment I made during our presentation was, we have heard reports that there is an outbreak of foot and mouth, but in this day and age surely that can be quelled pretty quickly, we should be back to normal within 2 or 3 weeks.  I know it sounds stupid, but I truly believed that this thing could be stamped out and eradicated fairly quickly.  I knew that animals would have to be slaughtered and killed, but to watch it unfold as it did was just horrifying, absolutely horrifying.  From that day since, I haven’t been auctioning.  

           I was just about to say, Wednesday February 23rd 2001, was a bit chaotic.  Thursday, were you still trading?  

           No we didn’t have an auction that day.  The animals had left the market and by Friday of that week it was [EMPHASIS]  shut down at 5pm, for everybody.   
         
 So what actually happened?  

          All the market was basically shut down, it had what was called a D notice placed on it to say we couldn’t trade any more.  Then, I can’t remember the exact time, but more or less, I think 2 to 3 weeks later we got the first case down in West Cumbria, a man who was a sheep buyer in our [EMPHASIS] market.  He used to buy sheep from all the markets, and then came to within a few miles of our market, and then we knew of his problems.  We kept hoping and hoping that it would be contained, and then the first week in April it actually hit Cockermouth [PAUSE].  It was then on the Sunday morning I got a telephone call from the farming club, a farmer up in Cockermouth who said I’ve got foot and mouth, he was actually quite emotional.  He was very concerned, he didn’t know what to do, or what the procedure was, he was obviously concerned about the valuation and I was able to tell him that we would do what we could to help him.  There were 4 cases very quickly after that.  I lost 3 of my biggest and best customers in the space of 48 hours, and then all hell broke loose.  

There must have come a point when you realised that you were going to have to be valuing stock that was going to be culled, that must have been difficult?   

           Yes, I mean the first evaluation I actually did was in the Penrith area. There was an old customer of mine from the Penrith area who for some reason decided he wanted me to do it, which at the time I was proud to be asked really because I hadn’t done it for quite a few years and it was nice of him to think of me.  I remember walking up the drive to meet the vet [EMPHASIS]   for the first time, I hadn’t a clue what to expect, I’d heard stories from other auctioneers who had been valued, I didn’t know whether I was going to see sick animals, distressed animals or what ever, I was just really nervous. Then I met the vet who was a man I actually knew because he played rugby, which was quite nice in a way.  Then he actually admitted it was his first case as well, so we were able to help each other.  I saw some sheep there that had no clinical signs at all, so that wasn’t too bad, and then I saw some cattle that were quite distressed [TONE QUIETER HERE]   and I thought well here we are, I’ve seen my very first case of foot and mouth disease.

           When you say ‘quite distressed’ can you be a bit more specific.  Were they showing symptoms?

            Barely able to walk [PAUSE],  frothing and snotty nosed [QUITE STUTTERY HERE]. Some of them were in a bad sort of state [STUTTER]    and their tongues were starting to drop off [THROAT CLEARING] .

           And were they going to be culled immediately after being valued?
    
           Yeh, yeh, well no, not immediately after.  This is, this is what upsets me more than anything, because that, that vet who done the valuation, inspected all the stock, and he sat at the kitchen table, [RAISED VOICE]    and the vet said to me, there are 2 things that have to happen immediately here.  First thing we have to get the army in, we must get the army in, we can’t cope with it. And secondly, these animals have to be slaughtered and removed off the premises [PAUSE], treated, you know, whichever way, in 24 hours.  And that [EMPHASIS]  was on the Monday when I did the valuation, the farmer who first noticed that he had foot and mouth the previous Wednesday,  and it was the following Sunday before they were put on a pyre and burned up.  Basically for them, the 12 days those animals shed viruses, and the vet said, if we don’t do something better [EMPHASIS] than this, this virus is going to spread through the county.  I said no you can’t be serious, and he said I’m telling you this isn’t working.  Now, the vets on the ground knew that was the case.  But the people In London didn’t, or they didn’t appreciate, or they didn’t want to know, what ever way it was, they let us down.  The guys on the ground, the vets on the ground, knew [EMPHASIS] what the problem was and how to address it.  And that’s why I feel so [EMPHASIS]   badly let down.

           So is that because they were overwhelmed.   I’m just trying to work out why there was this big delay?
           
           Yeh, there was already a big pyre burning in that village at the time, a huge pyre, and this guy who was a dealer of sheep, and I found he’d brought the sheep down from Longtown market.  They had a massive pyre burning of about 200 dairy cows on it.  This poor vet I felt sorry for him, he sat at the table, he asked headquarters- for permission to burn the animals, which could have been done within 48 hours, and he was refused because there was already a pyre burning from in the village, which is understandable.

 Right ok.  

He then asked for them to be buried, and the environmental agency said your not burning anything, so that was refused. He then rang the renderers to take the animals away and have them burned at a special place, and they said it will be 9 days before we can pick them up, because they were at the time arguing whether the government… But this vet was tearing his hair out, he said, I don’t know what the hell to do [RAISED VOICE FOR SENTENCE].     I can’t get [EMPHASIS]   any answers.  And in the end there was no other [EMPHASIS]     choice but to put them on a pyre and burn them, and that was on the Sunday, 11 days, 12 days after the farmers first noticed them, and that date was right.


           And was this before or after the contiguous cull?                                                                                                                           

 [LIKE NERVOUS LAUGHTER AND THROAT CLEARING FROM INTERVIEWEE] There were a lot of problems even before the contiguous cull , the contiguous cull started on [PAUSE]    was announced about March the 24th by Nick Brown in Parliament. 

Right, and this was before that?  

That was before that, that was about the first or second week in March.  By that stage then the disease, as I said,  the first week in April it got to Cockermouth, and all the farmers volunteered on the contiguous cull, it was supposed to be a voluntary scheme, but nobody was sure whether it was voluntary or not, it was supposed to be a population scheme, and all [EMPHASIS]   I found was, in Cockermouth they decided to volunteer their sheep to try and stop it spreading any further in West Cumbria.  And I say now [RAISED VOICE]    quite openly, our farmers in West Cumbria had not [EMPHASIS]  volunteered those [EMPHASIS] sheep and got rid of them and that disease continued to spread.  And we had a horrendous time for about 12 days where we were working about 14 to 16 hours a day to get rid of all the sheep in Cockermouth.

So in terms of your employees, is it just you shifted focus and not a very pleasant focus, or did you have to put some people off?

No, our part time staff that help us in the auction, they, most of them are farmers any way, and the job was finished in market so, they couldn’t come anyway because they didn’t want to leave their own farms, so that wasn’t a problem,  we didn’t have any staff to actually lay off and make redundant.  Anybody who was connected with animals and knew them, you know, they started valuing [PAUSE] and that was it.

So you were then putting in incredibly long days, and the bulk of that was just valuing stock?

Um, Um, non-stop, non-stop. [PAUSE]

And that was both infected and those involved in the contiguous, either voluntary or….? 

No, once we’d got rid the animals that had the disease, infected premises at Cockermouth, we then very much focused on the contiguous cull. Which were classed as non-infected farms.  We couldn’t do both of them really, so I had one valuer working to mop up any actual confirmed cases, and the rest of us at that time, for about 3 weeks, did all the voluntary stuff, which were the clean premises if you like.
 
 	I think as well, there was some confusion about the valuation process.  Did you find yourself caught up in that?

           Absolutely, still am now, yeh.  No I’m managing [PAUSE] I mean I'll give my time, that’s no problem. The first valuation that I did, I did mention that, I rang another valuer up from a rival firm if you like, I mean we do all try and help each other, I asked him to give an indication of how he was valuing the animals, and he did, and at that stage then he was saying, well ok that looked to be a fair valuation, which accounted for the loss of the stock so that was that.   We worked away up until March 24th, and then the Government did the most stupid thing, they brought out what they called a book price, and they gave farmers the option, if they didn’t want to have a valuer on their farm they could accept a set figure from the Government.  Now that set figure, in some cases, especially in our area for the hefted sheep off the fell  was higher than they had been valued.  So we sat down, we said ok, the figure exactly the government book price on a heefed fell ewe in Cumbria    value was 150 pounds, and that applied for everything [EMPHASIS],  and that applied for all [EMPHASIS] ,   so we said, ok,  if the government are going to give a 150 pounds for the worst sheep  [PAUSE AND EMPHASIS]  on those farms [EMPHASIS]             which they were [EMPHASIS]   it didn’t matter how old they were, what condition they were in, you know, how good they were, they were given 150 pounds [PAUSE].  Now I went out on my customers farm and I thought, well if the Government are going to give 150 quid for a 10 year old yew that’s blind in one eye and has no teeth, I’m going to go out and give my customers, for his good young sheep, I’m going to give him 200 pounds, I’ve got to [PAUSE]       I’ve got to [EMPHASIS] and so that’s how we started working.  We discussed it with them and we kept in touch with other valuers, and we [RAISED VOICE] always said as a firm that we were not [STRONG EMPHASIS]  going to get thrown into bidding wars, and I’ll be honest with you, I have farmers ringing me up saying it looks as if I’m going to get foot and mouth, how much are you going to value me cows at, and I said I’m going to value at what ever I see fit on the day.  That’s not good enough, so and so is going to give me fifteen hundred pounds average, what are you going to give? and I refused, and I put the phone down.  We always said that if we were put under pressure by farmers in valuation, we’re going to be on one. Most of our farmers were just grateful for what we did, 99 per cent [EMPHASIS]   of our farmers were grateful for what we did, there’s always going to be 1 per cent, and we always said if we[EMPHASIS]  were put under pressure, even once [EMPHASIS] - it doesn’t matter how good a customer they were, we would walk off the site [PAUSE]   and I had one occasion to do that when I walked around and said I’m sorry I’m not going to be with you on that, but I don’t think your stock is worth it, but I’m not going to fall out with you, if you want to go to another valuer firm, and they are [EMPHASIS] prepared to value them at that, so be it. 

           And this is a farmer in a contiguous cull? 

            Yes, and so that only happened to me once, and I hear among the grape vine he got another firm in to work prepared to give him his price.  But 99 per cent of our farmers believe in us professionally and were quite happy for us to do that, and so there’s a lot of talk about high evaluation, millionaire farmers, those farmers who had got a million pounds had a million pounds worth of stock, it was worth a million pounds.   What I would say to any body at all, is that if you were to go out on the farms that I valued for, in the Lake District, in West Cumbria, I would say 80 to 90 percent of those farmers would say, I don’t even want the money, give me my old stock back, give me my old sheep back.  And that is the absolute gospel truth, it wasn’t about money [EMPHASIS] and the press picked up on this, you know, rogue valuers, and rogue farmers, it wasn’t that at all.   Anybody who was in that situation would have wanted as much as they could get out of it, we all know that, that’s human nature.  Given the choice most of my customers would say they would rather have their stock back.

          But just going back to the Government and their valuation of stock, where you consulted as a local auction mart?

           No, not at all.

           Did you know of anyone else in the county?  
             
No, I don’t know where they got their figures.

            Local expert opinion, you don’t think  it was sought?

           They would speak to somebody connected with the job, but to my knowledge it wasn’t anybody in Cumbria, we weren’t even told about it [RAISED VOICE]  , I found out through somebody else who said, well there’s a book price on there.  In a way they really shot themselves in the foot with the book price, and then they took the book price off later in the summer, it disappeared, and all of a sudden they brought out a new set of figures which was different again, and so I don’t think anybody can be blamed for valuation.  I can only speak for our firm and not others, but our firm acted properly in every way, thoroughly professionally [PAUSE]    even to our detriment.  We were –this may have been promoted by other valuers-  but we were a name for not being very good valuers for farmers because they felt, you know, that we weren’t prepared to give as much as others. That seemed to get around the county, not really in our areas but in others.  Most of our customers took valuers and we gave them as much as we thought we could.  But that’s being born out now the European auditors are in, they inspected our paper work, they felt that -this was their words-  that we had given them more help than anybody else, they were totally satisfied in the way we had conducted ourselves and that’s the end of the story.  There are other firms who are still under investigation.

           But as you said - going back-  for a lot of the farmers that you dealt with it wasn’t about money … there’s a lot of talk about breeding lines having suffered?
      
           Yes, I was very heavily involved in that.  We are the only firm of auctioneers who have registered sales of Herdwick sheep which is our local indigenous breed.  I valued thousands and thousands of Herdwick sheep that were slaughtered.

            There’s a figure isn’t there that’s been put out something like 30….     

 Well there’s 35 to 40 per cent of the whole flock was lost.  I valued thousands, and a lot of them on farms where they venture away from the neighbouring area to the Lake District and then come back.  I witnessed the slaughter of some good lines that are irreplaceable, they’ve gone. 

 Cattle as well or just the sheep? 

Just the sheep, just the sheep.  There will be cattle in other areas of the country, there will be people with cattle in exactly the same situation.  I'm thinking of the short horn breed, very short horn breed, there’s very little left in Cumbria.  But my speciality is Herdwick sheep. 

           You're saying that there are some breeding lines that have gone? 

           Yeh the most horrendous time for me was when the disease got to the Ribble valley in the south of the county and some customers of mine, and I was called down there, and a young couple about the same age as me, farming there, who lost everything on that farm, didn’t have the disease, taken out in total as dangerous contact subsequently were tested and did not have the disease.  And there were good lines that were introduced by the farmers family going back 3 or 4 generations, they’ve gone.  It affected that couple so badly.  The culling affected him so badly that they couldn’t stay on the farm, they gave up the tenancy, their farming breed were gone. 

           And they were quite a young couple, we’re looking at about late thirties? 

Quite a young age, who I wouldn’t say were renowned, but their reputation through the county amongst the fell farmers was such that in the short time, they had farmed there for 7 years, they had turned it round and had really performed a hell of a job on that farm, and it’s gone, and the Lake District has lost a nice farmer whose moved away, they just couldn’t stay.

So you’re saying that this could have consequences for like hill farming?

Oh yeh [EMPHASIS]  another farmer at W  whose  one of that particular family for generations and had been one of the top breeders in the county, he lost every single Herdwick tup  in his possession, every single one[EMPHASIS]  was slaughtered, again including some good lines[PAUSE]   yeh.

          So for you personally, I mean I’m stating the obvious, but this has been quite horrific, I mean I get the feeling that….

          It wasn’t at the time,

           But I get the feeling that part of this job you really enjoy, it is to do with a stock that goes back  generations,  and this is very particular to Cumbria?

        	 I feel very privileged, I’ve only been involved with the Herdwick sheep breeders since 1994, and I have been their registered    auctioneer since then.  And I don’t pretend to know any thing about Herdwick sheep, it’s takes generations of breeding to understand their sheep, what I think is a good sheep is my opinion and I don’t quote myself as being an expert in any way, but I know how to assess the market and I know who’s wanting what, and I can generally pick it in a sale where there’s interest and know that I can get on and get a good price.  I sat down at the last Herdwick sale we had the year before last with a breeder who is in his forties, and he said to me, do you think you’ll be getting to know the breed, and I said no, and he said I’m 43 years of age and I’ve been with them all me life and, and I think I’m beginning to say now that I know the sheep. And that gives me an indication.  But I just feel very privileged to be working with those men, I love the sheep, I think their fantastic sheep and I love the Lake District, and it’s been a privilege to be working amongst it. That was the hard thing for me, because I get a call from a farm to say I’ve got 16 tups wintering away at Siloth, and their basically all the tups I’ve got and they’ve got to go, will you go and value.  

Um, it’s hard.  

They [EMPHASIS]    were heart broken, I was just going down there to do a job and to value them, and at the time I tried not to think about it too much. It didn’t really start to get to me until [LONG PAUSE].    Whilst you're valuing you’ve got a job to do, you’ve got your instructions, you get up, you go, you value, I was more concerned with trying to do the valuation the best I could, to try and make it as easy for the farmer as I could, that was a new skill to learn.  Normally you go out on a farm and you have a laugh and a joke, you value the stock for them and you do your job professionally, this was different, this was trying to keep the farmers upright, trying to stop them from bursting into tears, or to control it if they did burst into tears.  I had times when I had farmers in tears, vets in tears, and slaughter men in tears, and that’s bloody hard to know what to do.   

           So what did you do? 

           Be very, very cruel actually, [RAISED VOICE] very, very professional, not try to sympathise , I found myself saying, you know, come on, pull yourself together lets get this batch of sheep done and we’ll go and sit in the kitchen.  Snap, snap, you know.

           Is that because you wouldn’t be able to do your job?

          	No, that was because I was concerned that if the farmers couldn’t get through it that day that the whole thing would break down.  I mean I did have one farmer who was up to his knees in the cow muck crying over his oldest calf, because she had chronically, you know, the disease really badly, and he was on his knees and I was trying to get him up of the floor, he’d totally [EMPHASIS]       lost it, you know.  An American vet who’d just flown in from South Carolina was standing there, and as he said to me, I don’t know what the hell to do with him.   So as well as doing the valuation, we  had to be a counsellor .  It was trying to assess what the mood of the farmer was, some of them were very very angry and you had to calm them down, others were upset.  It was trying to judge the situation as to how you deal with the farmer to get through it, and not to be seen to be upset at all, I felt it was very important that I should never [EMPHASIS]     be seen to be upset.  The only times that I did get upset… the first time I got upset was when I saw some week old lambs taken off the moors to be injected through the heart, and that got me and so I made the excuse that I had to go and do some totting up, and I walked away about 60 yards or so, looked over the fence, composed myself and got back again. That was the only time, the only time on a farm where it got me.  And I’ve got to say there’s been a couple of times when I’ve come home late at night sat in a chair and had a good blub, it actually makes you feel a slight bit better.
       
14 -16 hour day.   How did you manage to do it month after month?

            I’ve think through 6 week, I had half a day off. .

What about the day-to-day things like sleeping, eating, time with your family.   How was all that going on?

           There was no time with the family, and that made me feel guilty because P was 7 months pregnant at the time, with a 2 year old daughter as well.  She was tired and struggling and I was coming home late at night not wanting to talk, never really sat down and said I’ve been through this today and I’ve done that, I didn’t want to.  She sort of left me alone and was quite happy for me to do that, which in hindsight was pretty good of her [PAUSE AND SLIGHT LAUGH]      if there was any social life it was very difficult for me to do that because… I can give you one example.  I told you about the farmer on his knees, and I came home that night fairly early, it was a Sunday night at about half past seven, we were suppose to go to my mothers for supper, I thought she’d be pressing for what was going on but it was never mentioned, you know , but there was no social life or anything like that, and I always felt guilty [SPEAKING EXTREMELY QUIETLY HERE] 

A lot of your friends if they’re not in farming, they belong to a  farming community?

          	Most of my friends, I suppose in our social circle, there’s a mixture,  that’s the problem we have in the farming community, but I mean there’s no way I could have said, right I’m going to go to the pub.  Because if I’d gone to the pub and there’d been a farmer in there, who knew I was a valuer, I would have been sort of cast out.  There was a couple of times later on in the year when I had walked towards the pub to have a pint and so on and I stood outside but I daren't go in [QUIET AND SLOW SPEECH AGAIN]   which I was angry with that rather than upset.  I just try to do my best.

           So were you aware of that even where you live?

             Yeh.

           Did it restrict what you did?

           Yeh. Oh yeh, I mean those sheep, and all of those fields, I mean this isn’t actually my business patch so to speak. Penrith was the local auction mart, I did get a bit of valuation work in the area, but I was always conscious of going out, whether there were any farmers there.  I did have one night out in March, and I was on the watch all night cos I thought if there any farmers here I wont be welcome.  It wasn’t like that at all, but I mean the worry was always there in the back of my mind.

            Had you heard stories from colleagues, you know, that they’d had a difficult time?

            Nobody went out, just working 7 days a week and the job was there to be done. The idea was that if a valuation came in, it was inconceivable that you would say no I don’t want to do it, or I’ll leave it till tomorrow. Yes they could ring me at 7 o clock in the morning to be on the farm at 9 o clock and I would be there, or they would ring me at 10 o clock at night, as they often did, they seemed to work 24 hours, they thought nothing of ringing here at 10 o clock on a Saturday night saying there’s a valuation tomorrow at 8 o clock, be there.

           So how did you keep going? I mean in terms of your general health, it can’t have been good can it? 
           
            I’ll tell you what happened.  Before foot and mouth I’d been training quite hard, when I was playing rugby quite seriously, I was in training 3 times a week.  My frame weight is about16 stone, and I was about 15 stone and very very slim.  But up until foot and mouth I’d been training quite hard, just for myself really.  When foot and mouth first started, I dropped a stone and a half off, just through doing the valuations, which was no problem, I was pleased to do it because I was struggling with my weight, and then as summer went on the valuation bit stopped to the point were last autumn I got up to 18 stone.  I remember there was a gym  in Penrith, and I always wanted to go but I could never be bothered, or I was intending to go after the foot and mouth through the autumn I was trying to trying to help farmers sell calf, and I was working from September until December and I was averaging about 65 hours a week just making calls to farmers to try and help them sell stock.  That was a culmination. That was when it got me down.  That was when I was up the north in November.  I was probably drinking too much [PAUSE], can’t say that because I always drink at weekends, but it didn’t help, and by November that got me to the lowest point, I was ready to quit. I actually applied for another job, which [PAUSE] I didn’t get .

 Outside of your industry?

         	 Not outside of the industry, but not as an auctioneer, it was in the agricultural industry.  I just felt I’d reached the end.  Like all auctioneers I was getting a lot of stick from the farmers, I just felt that what ever we were doing wasn’t good enough, the selling prices weren’t enough, or they were too dear.  Nobody knew what the market price was, there was no auction and I was getting a lot of grief, not just me, the other auctioneers as well, and it got to the stage that I thought …I began to resent the farmers because I thought, you greedy people, you know, we worked our socks off to value, we tried to build a 2 million pounds auction market with really no idea of what the future holds for us, and I felt that they should be bloody grateful we were trying to keep ourselves there for them, and it got me down{PAUSE] to the point where just before Christmas, end of the year, I’d had enough[PAUSE].    One of the problems was I hadn’t had any holidays through the year.

           Did you speak to P about this decision?

           Yeh.

           And how was she about it?

          Cautious.  She said are you really sure that’s what you want [PAUSE], you know, it’s a no go back situation, once you’ve gone you’ve gone, you never go back.  But em, I’m going to be honest with you, the package was good, and the type of job it was, I thought well I’m going to be a lot more secure than I am now financially.  I couldn’t envisage that there would be anything like the pressure on me that was in the market, it’s a totally different kind of job, my job is as a marketer and a retailer.  Whereas this job was very much more analytical, organisational, no retail or admin at all, it wasn’t selling anything.

          And isn’t that the buzz of auctioneering?

             Oh yeh.  People can’t understand it, when you’re an auctioneer.

I just imagine that you speak very fast.

 Some auctioneers do as part of their style, but, any auctioneer, they’ve got to have an actor in them, you are an actor.  You’re a farmer because you have to know valuing the stock, and know what they’re going to make.  Because no matter what your state of mind is, when you get in the box, you’re there to get the best price for those farmers, and that means, if you can crack a joke to lift the atmosphere in the room to get people bidding you do it, you know, you’ve got to get mad with the buyers and bang the hammer on the table and say come on you buggers your not bidding enough. You know you have to sense the situation, and when it’s going well I always refer to it as going into a ring.  You're in a ring, stocks going up, in and out, in and out, you get a rhythm to the price and the hammer comes down next [EMPHASIS] price, next [EMPHASIS] price, next [EMPHASIS] and that’s what I call getting into the rhythm, and when you go on like that, it’s a really good feeling [EMPHASIS].

 	You must know an awful lot of farmers who come to the mart?

           It’s more [EMPHASIS] than a business relationship, because a lot of those families have done business with my friends for over 100 years.   There’s the selling side of it, and there’s obviously a lot of trust in me.  It’s a very difficult position for an auctioneer, you have to have the trust on both sides, the trust in the buyer the trust in the seller, so that they know your trying to get the best price possible for him, the buyers got to know that your trying to fleece him for every penny that he’s got, it’s an uneasy position in the middle. The buyer's happy with you, the seller won’t be and visa versa.

  Yes of course. 

  So that’s the difficulty of it, so there needs to be trust in there.  That’s just one side the job, the auctioneers side, the other side of the job is going on to the farms seeing the farmers, and that’s where it puts us apart from other people involved in agriculture.  More often than not, when you go to a farm, even if you are sort of cold calling, they make you welcome because you’re their auctioneer.  Oh here’s so and so, come in and have a cup of tea and a bit of cake, I’ve just got this bull, come an have a look at it or whatever, and generally you are made very welcome, whether you’ve an appointment or not, it’s not like being a traveller.  That’s a nice feeling, that’s why I always say to people in London, when I’m in the Lake District that’s my patch.

So it can’t have been easy when you felt that you had to avoid farmers?

           That didn’t particularly bother me.

          Did you get angry about it though?

          No, no I didn’t, well at the time yes [EMPHASIS]  but, I think I was really insecure and that…. It was disappointing rather than any thing else. It didn’t affect my life.

 	TAPE TURNED OVER . INTERVIEWEE SOUNDS UPSET.

           How can I describe it [LONGISH PAUSE]    I’ve been a victim really [PAUSE]  that’s not the right word to use… I think about those farmers, it was just part of the job, you had to do, and I didn’t see it as being anything other than that.  We had to stop the disease, I had no thoughts about [PAUSE]  the future of the market, we had to stop the disease and that was what it was about, so.  I was resentful, I didn’t think we had perhaps the recognition, and I still don’t think that, but I mean, that’s one of those things.  I don’t think that farmers have really given us, as part of the team, the credit, which we deserve.  I mean, at one stage in about April time, I went to the chairman of our company and said I’ve just worked 6 weeks straight through.  I’ve [PAUSE]   done about 85 thousand pound worth of valuation for the company, my wife’s7 months pregnant, it looks as though we are going to lose all our stock, I’m quite happy to keep on doing this and doing the best for this firm, but if the auctions not going to happen will you at least guarantee my salary till Christmas to give me a chance to get going, bearing in mind we’re in debt.  He said no I can’t do that, so I said, well how long are you going to guarantee it for, and he said, a year, and I said, so it’s April now, so I asked for 3 months, and he said, he couldn’t do any more than that.  And I got a bit tearful at that time, but, the job had to be done, and so I didn’t think about it.  I just said to P, be prepared if the auction doesn’t go ahead, I’m not going to get another job as an auctioneer anywhere else in this county.  We’d probably have to sell our house and be outside of it, and see what happens.  That was the biggest worry all the way through till September - and the new market development.

           So really from June till September you were limping along?

          Yeh, that was about the future, not the foot and mouth as such.

So in terms of your regular salary, what was happening?

           I was still being paid a regular salary, same salary as normal.  I mean I just didn’t know. If our board turned round and said, look it’s too much of a risk - but I couldn’t blame them for doing that [EMPHASIS ON SENTENCE]-    if they said, I’m not going to go ahead with the development, we’ve sold our old site to Sainsbury’s, were cashing in but we’re not going to be investing in the auction market.  Nobody could have blamed them for doing that, but I would have been finished, as an auctioneer, finished.  Because there’s no other firms -  bearing in mind West Cumbria’s relatively unaffected by foot and mouth- in this area or Carlisle or anywhere else, there’s no stock left, you know ,so they  [EMPHASIS]  don’t need any auctioneers.  

           A lot of the firms round the country are struggling far worse than the              Cumbrian market, so I could just see myself [PAUSE]   I began to see that I was possibly valuing myself out of a job and that either got me angry or made me feel guilty, because I’m the only farmer thinking, god this man does 5000 pounds worth of business with me – commission- business with me a year, he’s gone, that’s another nail in my coffin, and then I was feeling a bit guilty because he’s distressed at losing his stock and I’m thinking I’m going to be out of a job.  

Hellish.   

That was hard to take, especially through moaning a bit about the valuation.

          So do you think that was part of your spiralling down… I mean  the decision to look for other work ?
          
           No. No, because by that time the new market was announcing that it was going ahead.  

That was September?  

Yeh, yeh. Foot and Mouth, we knew was basically beaten by then, I wasn’t concerned about foot and mouth anymore.  We were going to survive here, the new market… the board had taken a very courageous decision to say go ahead with it.  My problem was, we were in a very tight shift, there were only two full time auctioneers, me self, and another man in the firm, but we cover only West Cumbria, and so what was happening was farmers were absolutely inundated with stock, this was stock which would have come through the market, and when you bear in mind that on a normal market day we might have had the sale of stored cattle, we might have had 200, 300, 400 store cattle to sell, which would have been sold within 4 hours.  Quite often we were going out on a farm, taking 2 hours to sell 10 cattle.  Sometimes I was going out on farms 3 or 4 hours in an afternoon and not getting a deal, and simply couldn’t cope, because 75 per cent of my time, by this time, was taken up with project managing the auction, sorting out the planning, selling sites, the final design, that was my job, 75 percent of my [EMPHASIS]     time through the day was taken up within the auction market.  And then at night I was picking up all my messages in the office, going home, putting the kids to bed, 7 o clock sitting down, and just responding to messages that had come in through the day, farmers saying, I’ve 20 cattle to sell or 50 sheep to sell, and that was all I was doing, was getting through the day, and it got to me then.  And I said to me board, you know, we’re just swimming to keep our head above water, we’re not coping, farmers are getting mad, saying you know, I’ve had these sheep on your books for a fortnight {COUGH] you know, and you couldn’t cope, and that was when it got low because farmers were complaining to my Directors, who complained to me [EMPHASIS] I say, look, what the hell [EMPHASIS]  do you want me to do, take on another 6 auctioneers [QUESTIONING VOICE] because that’s what we need to do.  It wasn’t working, and that was when it got me to the lowest, because farmers were ending up having a go, and I’m saying, Christ, give me a break. [COUGH] excuse me.  It got me down, it got me colleague down, it was just a continuation, foot and mouth was beaten but it was in the aftermath [LONG PAUSE]
    
  	You are right in the firing line aren’t you. [PAUSE]  What about other family members…. your parents… are you close to your parents?  

           Yeh, Ps parents live in the Penrith area, my parents live in the Cockermouth area.

            Did you find yourself talking to them or…?

           Yeh, I certainly talked to my parents about it.

           Did that help?

          Yeh, I’ve always been very close to both our families.

           But they don't farm…?

           They're not farming, but they’re quite heavily involved in a way, in that my father – his friend is actually an architect for the new mart, so he knows the business, he knows the people I work for.  Didn’t [EMPHASIS] that much discuss the day to day things we were doing on farms, but certainly [EMPHASIS]  discussed the future, and- what can I say - stick in and do your best, don’t worry, things will turn up.

           Have you got brothers and sisters?

          I’ve 2 sisters, yes.  
    
          And are they local?
          
           They live in the middle of C, married with children, didn’t see anything of them at all.

          And they're not connected to farming?

          No

          And neither is P’s family?

          Not directly, no.
      
          Your friends…   I mean was there anyone that you could turn to outside of the family?

           No. 

          It’s not you anyway?
 
         	 I don’t mind talking to people interested.  Some people say what’s it like.  More people not connected with farming were more interested in what’s it like seeing violence, you know.  I’m trying to explain that actually I’ve just saw a thousand killed in 3 hours, you know.  And that side of things, It never bothered me seeing anything slaughtered, it never did.  I don’t know why that is, I mean, me family worked in the butchery trade somewhere down the line.  Looking into a slaughter house doesn’t affect me, seeing an animal killed does not bother me at all, it was why they were being killed, and it affected me when slaughter men were in tears, it was getting to them.  

           But as far as support goes, no. I felt a bit resentful with my directors, and that was one of my problems in the back end of this, 2 of them got foot and mouth and went down with it.  Obviously in those situations they have to look after their own family and their own farms, but not once did any of them ever enquire and say, how are you doing, are you ok.  I mean one of them didn’t speak to me for 6 months, and then he turned up in November with all guns blazing and really ripped into me, and said you're not doing good enough and I’m getting a lot of complaints.  And, you know, I had to really bite my tongue and say where the bloody hell were you [PAUSE],   cos you didn’t come near.   And that was all part of the contributory problems.   I have to say that em [PAUSE] ollowing on from that, I sort of made up my mind, that if an opportunity came up that I would go.  I did have a big heart to heart with the board where, I had made my mind up where if they still insisted that I was doing such a bad job, then I was going to hand my notice in.  I had it written out, I showed it to P [wife], and she said, are you really sure about this, and I said yeh, I’ve made my mind up.  I said if they start ripping into me and telling me I haven’t been doing my job, I said I’m out, finished, I just felt I couldn’t work there anymore.  And em, there’s one director that I am very very [EMPHASIS] close to.  He got me to go to the firm and he backed me all the way through, and I told him the night before what I was going to be doing, and he’d obviously had a word with the rest of them, and he sat me down there and there was no animosity at all, they perhaps realised the situation was more extreme than they had thought, and they turned round from being sort of aggressively, you know, having a go at me, to saying, I’d really like to see you in such and such situation and wanted to help.  And that helped a lot, and I said, well I’m so pleased because I don’t want to leave.  But, you know, that’s not the way he felt, and that was in the letter.  And he said to me, that’s a dangerous thing to put on the table if you don’t mean it, and I said, but I do mean it.  And they were astounded.  They hadn’t realised how it had quietly been getting to us.  That was one of the problems.  So, that cleared the air an awful lot in December, it has been easier.

Just to close for now because I’ve had you talking for over an hour and that’s really rotten…….

……..  I’m used to talking for 4 hours at a time [LAUGHTER]

 I know, but you need some time with your family.  The future? And I’m going to leave it as open as that.

         The future [LONG THOUGHTFUL PAUSE]  The future professionally with the market is going up.  I’m very concerned as to what our role will be.  The rules and regulations which DEFRA are imposing on markets are just ridiculous.  They're out to make sure that we don’t operate.  There’s no other way out [EMPHASIS], I was a meeting with them last night, and they are putting such draconian measures out just to make our businesses underrated.  We [EMPHASIS]  want the markets, our farmers desperately want the markets.  The only people that don’t want the markets are DEFRA and they're blaming the sites nothing else but the sites, it’s just ridiculous. 
        
  Are you talking here about all this bio security?

                     	Bio security and animal movements [RAISED VOICE HERE]. Animal movements [EMPHASIS], they’re saying are the root cause of the problem.  And what they consistently [EMPHASIS] ignore, is how the disease got into the country.  And we’ve been so [EMPHASIS] badly let down.  Until [EMPHASIS]    we know how this disease got into this country, it could come back at any minute. And to say [EMPHASIS]   to the farmers, no I’m sorry, but you’re not going to be allowed to move your animals as you use to [PAUSE]   is not good [EMPHASIS]  enough [PAUSE],   that [EMPHASIS]     is not good enough.   All [EMPHASIS]    their doing, is basically, putting such pressure on the farmers, to make their businesses unworkable as well.  So I’m very concerned [EMPHASIS] about the future, em [LONG PAUSE],   of the business.  Personally em [LONG THOUGHFUL PAUSE]       just to have a stable year, were I can come home and enjoy the family. Not [EMPHASIS] to have the pressure on [PAUSE], things have been very, very fraught in this house [PAUSE].     More [EMPHASIS]   so over the last 2 months than when Foot and Mouth was on.  And things [EMPHASIS] have been very, very fraught for us [PAUSE].  And I think that’s the backlash of what happened last year. And [PAUSE]  I [EMPHASIS] would like to get myself a lot fitter [EMPHASIS]  than I am now.   I really let myself go, I want to get weight [EMPHASIS] off, get fitter, take better care of myself.

           So when you said fraught, and this is personal – you can tell me to mind my own business- but, do you mean for you and P [wife] .

 Very.  More so since just before Christmas. 

Here A became very, very quiet and it is difficult to hear the tape.  From what I remember he spoke to me about not having enough time with and for each other and having worries about maintaining an expected standard of living  - for example having family holidays.  He spoke about a trip to Paris that P has organised in the near future for she and A and without the children.  A does not want to go:


I don't like cities, much prefer to slob about or to take the kids.  But I understand, we didn't get any time at all last year.  I took two days off after he [baby son] was born to look after M [young daughter] and that was it.  So P has had a very rough time, yes very rough.  The problem with my job even during normal times is if you don't leave, get out of the house,  the phone always [EMPHASIS] rings. It starts about half past seven and it's a farmer and I'll say I'm on holiday and he'll say, what's the sheep trading at and that's the way it goes.

I suppose it's because farming is not a nine to five job.

No, no.

A recounted a few more tales of being called out to value stock during holidays and how this was always a strain on the family.  I asked A if he had anything to add and thanked him for his time.  He opened the dining room door and M  bounded in, cautiously eyeing me up as she scrambled up onto A's lap.  We had been talking for well over an hour.

G works at a secondary school and likes me to visit her there, ""oh home's a bit chaotic with my boys and I can always find time at work.  The Head's very supportive of this project.""  I arrived during break time and the school was awash with young people and noise. G led me to, ""well it's a bit of a stock room really but quiet and it's got comfy chairs [laughs].""  We sat next to each other with our chairs turned so that we could face one another and it was indeed very peaceful.  A small window overlooked an expanse of trees.

Can you tell me a bit about yourself?

I am 47.  I have 3 children.  I have been married twice.   Got 3 boys, 19, 17 and [one] from a second marriage who is 6, so I have my hands full.  I have been here at C School for… this is my second year.  Previously I was in B school as a secretary there, and I was there for thirteen years, and I’ve lived in B for 20 years [PAUSE]  so I know the village people round there quite well.

Were you actually born there?

I was born in Kendal and the family moved to Carlisle when I was 3 and we lived at Stanwix.  I went to school and then I went on to Trinity and then left when I was 15 and started work in a shop and then I sort of progressed from that to an office junior and sort of ended up working for the [local newspaper] offices.  And then I got married to a Geordie, went to live in Newcastle for a year and then I missed the Lake District and the countryside very much; I didn’t think I would but I did and we moved back over here, because my husband loved the countryside as well, and we moved back here.

What is your parents’ background, are they Cumbrian?

Mum was born in Barrow and Dad was born in Shropshire.  Yes, they were in Carlisle for a long time.    

Do you have brothers and sisters?

I have a brother who lives in Sunderland [PAUSE] and one in Hartlepool and his wife works [ name] University, so they are sort of in between the two.

Do you have regular contact?

Oh yes, yes.  

So would you describe your family as quite close?

We are.  Dad died unfortunately about seven years ago.  He was a real character my Dad, he use to have a [local radio] programme [PAUSE] collecting 78 records.  Mum and Dad moved to B not long after I was divorced, they came to support me and my two boys really, but Dad was only there for two years and then he died.

Your present partner, is he local?

Yes, he’s from a farm at G.  His brother ended up with the farm.  There’s a long story behind that but my husband now works at the cemetery in C, he’s cemetery foreman and I knew of him but it was about four years after I was divorced that we started going out and we’ve now been married seven years.  His brother lost all his animals to foot and mouth.  He’s sold the farm and has bought another one so he’s starting up again.

Did he sell the farm as a direct consequence of foot and mouth?

Not really, he was doing it anyway.

So do you think it was a sort of . . . .?

Well [PAUSE]  I don’t know really [LONG PAUSE].  No I think he’d already made his mind up to do that anyway.   He sold the farm as a building site and it was a family farm.

Did it go back generations?

Well it was a rented farm but the family had been on it for a long time and they’d been through hardships.  The people who they were renting from, they were fine, but when the lady died she left it all to the animal refuge [PAUSE]  so they had to buy [EMPHASIS]   the farm back off the animal refuge, and you couldn’t afford to buy the whole farm so they only bought half of the farm, therefore there wasn’t enough work for the two brothers.  It was a nightmare.

Was it a mixed farm?

I don’t know.  I think so, yes.

So it’s been sold for building?

All the land’s been sold.

And that’s around G?

Yes.

So he’s moved out to another area has he?

Yes.

You are probably too young to remember but do you have any memories at all, of the ’ 67 foot and mouth outbreak?

I do because my Dad used to work for the Ministry of Agriculture.   He was a farm wages inspector.  He got chased many a time with a gun off a farmer [CHUCKLES], but at that time he had to carry his wellies, his disinfectant and everything, in the back of the car.  So yes we were involved in a way.

So you have memories of that?

I do, yes.  When there was first talk of foot and mouth I just thought, oh no not again.

Can you remember your first thoughts about this outbreak?

It was in the North East wasn’t it when they first said [LONG PAUSE].  I was just hoping [EMPHASIS] that it wasn’t going to spread, because where I live is a farming community and I knew from past how quickly it could [EMPHASIS]  spread, and obviously the school here where I work is a farming school.  A lot of the children live on farms so they would all be affected by it, which they were.

In the early stages was there a feeling that actually this could become a problem?

Not initially.  We just kept fingers crossed and hoped that it wouldn’t.  We weren’t really prepared for what was going to happen.  We had to sort of put things in position fairly quickly when we realised the enormity of it.

So contingency plans just had to be made as and when?

Yes.

So what actually happened, was it that children just suddenly weren’t coming to school?

We used to get parents phoning up  saying, do we send our children to school or not, is it safe for them to come to school, can they catch it, can it be transmitted from farm to farm by the children.  To which we sort of said, well, we’re sorry but we don’t know [EMPHASIS], we’re going to have to put the responsibility onto you.  We can say we will support you if you keep your child off, we won’t… you know normally if you keep your child off school for a length of time, people get called in and find out what’s happening, but we said to them, you wont be penalised, nothing will happen. We support you because it’s your livelihood, and if you need work for your child we will send it home for you or we will get it to you some way.

So this must have caused quite a lot of disruption.  What about the children who were [emphasis] coming, was there a sense that they were worrying about the ones who weren’t? 

Oh yes.  I’m a First Aider and we lots of them distressed and we just had to comfort them and say we’ll do the best we can.  We’ve all got to stick together and support each other, and generally just to talk about it.  I think they needed just to get it out of their systems how they were feeling.  It was a very emotional time, because there was times when I had to go and get a child out of the classroom and say, you’ve got foot and mouth, you’ve got an hour to decide whether you go home with your family or you find somewhere else to live and you keep coming to school.   I mean the majority would go home but for the children who were sitting exams, it was very [[EMPHASIS] traumatic, and some of them did decide to live within the village or with friends, so they could continue with their studies and get through them because we didn’t know how long it was going to last.

So you did have a number of children who were placed with other families?

We did yes, or with grandparents.  For them [EMPHASIS], knowing that the beasts were being slaughtered and not being able to be with Mum and Dad and brothers and sisters, you know.   They coped really [EMPHASIS]  well. I was quite impressed, you know, for such young people to cope like that. 

 Yes, exam time is a very stressful time anyway.  

Yes, and they did do well, so we were really proud of them.

I’m trying to get a feeling of how you and your colleagues were giving all this extra support and getting on with your daily work load which I have no doubt in a school this size is pretty phenomenal anyway, what was happening for you and your colleagues throughout all this?

We just rallied together basically.  We got up a list of all the children who were affected.  We had a list of those who had had foot and mouth and a list of those who were… they had different type of notices put on them and we had lists.  We just tried to help each other and tried to keep on top of it all.  

The day that they said they were going to do the cull, that was just an absolute nightmare [EMPHASIS], and in fact, me and my colleagues, we just broke into tears, we just said that means our village is going to be wiped out if this is going to happen; because when we [EMPHASIS]  heard it was going to be everything [EMPHASIS], but on the way home in the car we heard that it was just going to be the cattle. 

Terrible.

It’s just a way of life.  I didn’t realise until they weren’t there… you know, the animals had disappeared, it was horrible [EMPHASIS]… how much I took them for granted, they were just part of my daily life.  Taking the dog up the road and the fields are all empty, you just think this is strange, it was like a calm before a storm, you know.    

Your youngest boy goes to the local school does he?

Yes.

So what was happening for him?

Well one of his best friends, he was off school, kept from day one they said right, that’s it, we’re going to bar the doors, we’re going to stay on the farm.  In fact I use to drop things off for them on the way home, you know, if they wanted to post anything, I’d pick it up and post it for them.  I don’t know how they caught it but they did.  And then I had to explain to my six year old, [friend’s] animals have died and when he comes back to school you’re going to have to help him.  He just sat there and he said, it’s very sad isn’t it Mummy [CHUCKLES].  I said, it is very sad, yes [PAUSE].   I don’t think they really realise the enormity of it.

At school did they have mats down?

Yes.

 And did they have to wear special footwear?

Not really.  We just had the disinfectant mats at the gates and the cars had to go over the mats at all the entrances.

And in the school at B?

Yes we had mats down there as well.

There was no suggestion at the primary school of closing it at any time?

There was talk about it, but no they said they were going to keep open.

What about your older sons, are they still at home?

My eldest has just moved out; he’s just moved down the road in the village with a friend to see if they can survive.  Yes [both] are both at home.

Where are they in terms of education?

My eldest is nineteen, he’s working in C  at a  supply company.  [Next one] is here, he is doing his A levels, he’s in the lower sixth form.

So did it affect them in quite different ways?  Did they talk about it?

Not so much [oldest],  [next one] who’s here, he’s in Young Farmers and his best friend lives on a farm, so I mean he was more upset about it I would say.  He found it hard but you just have to get on with it.  

And what about your partner?

He was very upset obviously.  He was upset anyway that his brother was going to sell the farm but to have this as well.  Every time we heard of any of our friends getting the disease, the  farm getting the disease, we would just send them a card and say we’re thinking about you, if you need anything just ring us.  It brought a lot of people closer together I think.

Did it affect your social life then?

Yes. Well we couldn’t go out anyway, we just stayed at home but we would phone them a lot  [LAUGHTER].

Do you think that helped?

Yes.  Everybody had to cope with it in their own way.  There was one girl I use to ring and she just use to cry and cry and cry and they didn’t get it in the end. Her husband hung onions [EMPHASIS], which is an old wives tale, around the farm.  He was on front of the news with his onions, trying to protect his farm.  But it did, he never caught it, but his sheep had to be culled because of the disease further down the road [PAUSE].  Others would say, oh we’ll just get on with it, we’ve just got to do what we can, if we get it, we get it.  I think it was harder for those who didn’t get it [PAUSE], I think you’ll find, the waiting, not knowing.  Once you caught it, that was it and they had to deal with it, but the ones who just had to wait… there’s a farm right in the middle of the village that caught it and nobody else did round about and we couldn’t understand why.

There are a lot of lay theories about how it spreads; do you have a particular explanation?

I think the burning of the carcasses.  I think it was wind born.
You could tell by the way the wind was blowing and when you had these pyres, it just seemed to be carried by that.

Were you aware of those pyres where you live?

Yes, and round here.  The smell was absolutely [EMPHASIS]   horrendous.  Some days you couldn’t deal with it. 

 And a lot of these farming children had to deal with that as well.

Do you have any future concerns, particularly about health in terms of say water pollution?

It’s crossed my mind but not… I hope [EMPHASIS] it’s been dealt with properly [LAUGHTER]  because we’re not far from Great Orton.

What do you think of that disposal site?

I’ve never been near.  I always to come through Great Orton on my way to school but I don’t go that way anymore.  It was just awful to see the pictures on the television and in the paper, all these bodies being put in, and you’d be coming to school and there would be these wagons [EMPHASIS]  coming past and you could smell the death [EMPHASIS & PAUSE], you could smell it, it was horrible [EMPHASIS].  I just hope it doesn’t come back that’s all.

In terms of your workload increasing, it must have been stressful?

Oh it was very [EMPHASIS]   stressful.

So where did you find release.  I know you say you came together with your colleagues but you were still all within it, so was there a sense that you could go somewhere else?

Well, because it was happening all around you, you couldn’t really.  Everywhere you turned, hmm just talking to others.  We were supporting others, and because I was thinking of the children here it helped me deal with it.  Rather than thinking of myself, I was thinking of the children and what they [EMPHASIS]   must be going through because I [EMPHASIS]   don’t live on a farm.  For them [EMPHASIS]   it must have been awful.  I mean there’s one girl came back after they’d been cleansed and everything and she just burst into tears one day and she said the cat had gone missing and they’d lost all there other animals and she was really upset because the cat had gone missing.

In your day-to-day job description, obviously you have a lot of contact with children and you’ve got to have a rapport I suppose with this age group, but I was wondering - because you are easy to talk to -   if you needed to have any sort of formal training in terms of communication, especially for situations such as this?

No.  I suppose the various jobs I’ve done; I’ve always sort of done reception work and talked to people.  When I was in the Cumberland News, I was in the advertising department and in the reception there and you had all sorts of walks of life coming in there.  You had farmers who wanted to advertise or you had people who come who wanted to sell houses.  You just learned how to deal with everybody as they were.

Was there any point when you felt you were in this too deeply and maybe thought, “ I don’t quite know what these children need, I feel they need more than just me talking with them?”

Not really [PAUSE].  They seemed too [PAUSE]  feel that once they’d spoken about it, it seemed to help them say, ooh right now, I’ll go back.  You know how a child, they can ask you something really deep and meaningful and you think, oh gosh, how am I going to answer that, and you say what you think is going to be best and they say, right I’m off to play footie now, and they go and your left thinking, oh right [EMPHASIS].  They were like that, you would talk to them and they would come out with all these deep things and they’d say oh alright I’ll go back to class now, I feel ok now and they would go and you’d think, oh right, I’ve helped them.

We did have somebody coming with leaflets saying about bereavement counselling for pets and we did have leaflets about that but I don’t think anybody took it up.

That’s interesting.  So where did that information come from, was it initiated by the school?

No because we had so much publicity… we had a lot of publicity because the press where getting fed up of foot and mouth and they wanted a different angle so they thought, is there an agricultural school, and we’re the only one, so they came on us.  We had the Sun and the News of the World.  

So national.  

Yes.  Everybody came and they interviewed; Border television, Cumberland News.  They all landed one day on us, and the Head had to do umpteen interviews and I think people said to me [PAUSE]…I’ve forgotten what the question was. 

 Don’t worry, I was just asking about the fact that you’d had offers for bereavement counselling for pets.  

Yes.  And I think this is why, because we got so much advertising that they just said, oh look we’ve got an outlet there, we’ll come in and say.  So we put up posters and we gave out leaflets to the children, but I don’t think any of them took it up.  I think they all helped each other. 

What did you think of that media coverage?

[LAUGHTER] They covered it very well.  I mean they interviewed one particular girl who had to stay away from home.  They covered it very well [PAUSE],   but it was a hectic day and we had people in and out and everywhere, and people phoning up with, can we come too, and we said, oh yes everybody else is here [TALKING LOUDLY HERE]    just come.   They took some photographs of our Science Technician feeding the lambs that were going to be culled, which I thought was a bit sick. 

 Well yes, I was going to say that because of course the school had its own animals but they were all culled?  

They were all culled, and we were worried that it was going to happen during term time, because the children were coming in everyday and they were used to seeing the pigs and the sheep and everything.   

So the school had sheep with lambs is that right?  

Sheep, lambs and they had a huge pig with piglets, who was gorgeous.   

So will the school restock?

Yes, hopefully shortly.  But what worried us was that we were going to have to shut the whole school down while the animals were in cull but we got round it by blocking off the agricultural block, which is over there, and use that as a separate… You know, nobody could go in there and it was all fenced off.

Animals are used as part of the curriculum were they?

Yes.  
They were used in lots of different ways probably.  
Well there is a lot of children as I say from farming community and some of them go to the agricultural college at Newton Rigg after here, so they’re brought up to know how to bring up animals and butcher them and things [LAUGHTER].  Well it’s part of their lives isn’t it. 

Well it’s a natural cycle isn’t it. 

 Yes. 

 Well that is a very interesting point isn’t it, because there have been some suggestion that it’s all got a bit too emotive and farmers are used to killing their stock, but I think there is this sense that there is a life cycle isn’t there?

Oh yes.

  Even if it’s short.  

 It upset me, because my brother in law had the farm… I’ve milked a lot of those cows and I knew them by name, do you know what I mean.  Well a lot of the farmers do.  When you’re milking them every day you know all their little habits, you know what they are, and to lose them is awful.

What was the worst aspect for you [emphasis] with foot and mouth?

The worst aspect [LONG PAUSE].   In what context?  

 I’ll leave it as broad as that. For some people it’s straightforward for others its lots of bits.  

There were lots [EMPHASIS]  of bits.  It was just the fact of losing all those animals [SENTENCE WHISPERED]  and the impact it was going to have.  Because as I say, it’s part of my [EMPHASIS]   life, I’ve always been brought up in the Lake District.  And where do the farmers go from there, what do they do.  I know a lot of them have packed in, don’t want to restock, but the ones who have sons coming on are having to stock.  I mean sheep are beginning to appear in the fields.  I don’t think my brother realised how bad it was being in the North East.  It was like Cumbria was sort of sectioned off and it was just all happening here and the rest of the country hadn’t a clue what was going on. I know they did in Devon, but because we’re just a compact county [PAUSE]… it was just awful to see.

Was there anything good that came out of it?

[LAUGHTER] Anything good [PAUSE].  I think it was just the sense of community spirit, where everybody helped everybody else.  And as I say, it’s come on from there; it’s brought people closer together.  I think that’s about the only thing that was good about it.

So do you think that is sustainable?

I hope so [PAUSE].  At the time it’s so intense that it’s stronger then [PAUSE]  but when you start to talk about it, it brings it all back again.  We went through a lot with the book [PAUSE]    and you’d think you were getting over it and then you see all these films and you think, oh my gosh [EMPHASIS].  It just brings it all back again [PAUSE].

Do you feel that the crisis that you [emphasis] went through, I mean certainly in terms of what was happening here at the school but also at home, whether it had an impact on your health?

Just emotionally, emotionally tiring, I think.  Physically you just get on with it [LAUGHTER] 

 What, you [emphasis] get on with it?  

Yes, I [EMPHASIS]  get on with it [LAUGHTER]

And your children?

They cope very well.  They supported their friends and helped them.

No health worries or problems sleeping?

Little [son] got upset as I say, when his friend lost their animals [SPEAKING QUIETLY, SLOWLY AND EMOTIVELY]    but I sat and talked to him and sort of said, he’ll get some more [PAUSE]  and that satisfied him.

Just finally what do you see for the future.  Obviously foot and mouth had a huge impact but what are the farmers going to do now, particularly those who aren’t going to restock.  Do you think that foot and mouth is going to have a long-term impact on Cumbrian farming communities?

I think so.  I think it will.  Some of the farms have been established for so [EMPHASIS]  many years and some of the animals are irreplaceable, especially the herdwicks.  People are bitter who have lost specialised animals.  It affected everything.  Nobody would come near the county [PAUSE]   it was a no go zone, it was like we were cut off from everybody else.  I don’t think the children will forget it in a hurry.  Having said that, now they don’t seem to talk about it as they were doing but we are restocking soon so hopefully…  A lot of the sheep dogs I feel sorry for [VOICE TONE LOUDER AND LAUGHTER.]

That’s interesting. What are they going to do about that?

I think one of the worst things happened to me was, there was a field full of sheep down the road here and got up every day, they were still there, still there, you know, and I was in reception and a lady came in and she was in floods of tears, and I said, what’s the matter, and she said, they’ve just shot all the sheep down the road [PAUSE]  and they’ve shot the sheep dog as well.  Apparently the farmer hadn’t been told they were going to do this [PAUSE]  and I just thought there was no need [EMPHASIS]  for that, there was no need.  That was just awful and when I was driving home there was all sheep along the roadside [EMPHASIS].  

And the reasons for shooting the dog? 

 I don’t know, you tell me.  It was those sorts of things, you know…  My neighbours, on the day that we found the cull, my neighbours were out and they were just crying [EMPHASIS] and we just cried together and said what are we going to do [EMPHASIS] you know, what’s it going to be like [EMPHASIS].  But then we thought well it’s the farmers we should think about. 

 But like you said, it does have an impact on everyone else doesn’t it.  

 Oh it was the whole village.  Most of the children here are from small villages [PAUSE] and it was all of the villagers around [PAUSE] they were coming in with such awful tales, seeing carcasses [PAUSE]  and these trucks going past and smelt, and then you see these pyres.  Infact they were going to have a pyre over the back of the school here, and some neighbours complained and said the affect of the smell would affect them so they didn’t do it in the end, they ended up taking them to a burial site [EXTREMELY UPSET AT THIS POINT].

Is there anything that you would particularly like to comment on before I turn the tape off?

I can’t think of anything off hand.

I thanked G for her time

When I set out to find A's quite isolated bungalow, it was a night without stars, pitch black and lonely.  I failed to spot landmarks and got lost!  I spoke with A's wife over the phone a couple of times but I could feel the panic rising.  When I eventually arrived, both A and his wife were standing on their drive looking anxiously towards me.  Their outside light flooded my path.  ""You got here then"", A remarked grinning.  I was led into a living room crammed with toy 'sit-on' dumper trucks and tractors. I was introduced to 20 month old S who  chatted away and happily lined up his toy vehicles for me to admire.  S was led away by his mother and A and  I settled ourselves.  A was clearly exhausted, ""Aye left the house at 7 and not been long in (this was well past 8pm), but that's the business.""  I suggested that we could arrange another time but, ""no you're all right, not after the trouble you've had finding us [laughing].""  I switched on the tape recorder.


So where I usually start is by asking you to tell me a bit about yourself and your background?

I’m an agricultural contractor by trade.  I’m a farmer’s son, my father use to have a dairy farm I think that was about [19]83 when he sold that.  I went to an agricultural college at Newton Rigg at Penrith.  I did a nine-month course there.    [INTERUPPTED BY YOUNG SON CRYING]  When I left there we bought another farm, but that was just a livestock farm, a sheep farm but that didn’t last very long. There was a few financial problems shall we say, so he’s retired now and we started contracting.  [SON COMES INTO ROOM] When I came out of agricultural college I started as self employed, I worked round till 1993 then I started on the contracting side when I bought my first tractor and that was the year I got married as well.

So your background is really dairy farming, you may not be old enough to remember the 67 outbreak?

No, not quite, I was born in ‘64 but I was [PAUSE]   I can’t really remember anything that happened in 67, I mean me Dad's told me because there were farmers not too far away from us, we lived the other side of Carlisle at that time, at Kirkandrews on Eden there was a farm down there, that went down when we were kids, who had it and I can remember him talking about that but I can’t remember it.

Has your Dad talked about it since this outbreak?

A little bit.  I don’t think there was anything like the volume of restrictions we’ve had this time.  There were movement restrictions at the time [EMPHASIS] but I didn’t seem to last anything like as long as this time, obviously this is a bigger outbreak.  

Do you know why your Dad sold up in 83?

I can’t really remember, we sold the dairy farm that we had. We were out on a farm near Silloth for 18 months I think.  I was at College then we bought the one , that's where they live at now.  But like I say that didn’t last very long, we never really got started properly there.  We sold most of the land off and kept the house and about 40 acres and the farm houses, so they still live there.

So do you let the land?
We just let the land out. There’s just twenty to twenty two acres left now.

And is that grazing land now?

Oh yeh, it’s marginal sort of land.  There are [EMPHASIS] dairy farmers round at Oakliegh Heath. Just on the Border there, there’s a dairy farm.

So have you got brothers and sisters?

I’ve one younger brother.

Is he in farming?

He’s in the contracting job with me as well.

You set up together then?

No, well I started five or six years before him and then he decided he wanted to come into the same job as well but we decided to keep our businesses separate but we work together, he works for me most of the time.  But he has his own tractors and machinery as well, but we try to buy machines that compliment each other so we can work together then. 

 Yes because your working in the same areas, you don’t want to be competing.  

Yes that’s it really [LAUGHTER]  I do the slurry  handling side of it and he does the muck side of it.

Does he live in the area?

He still lives with my parents because he’s not married, so that’s where we’re based from.  All our machinery and everything is up there. 

 Sorry, where is that again?  

It’s about four miles further north.  

Okay yes.  
We bought this property a year past May I think it was.  We bought off of  S's [WIFE'S] grandmother.  We have about three and a half acres of land  on the river bank here; the river is just at the bottom behind us, with the intention for me to build a shed, a workshop in the yard here for my machines.

 So you’re based here?  

Yes, but we’re struggling for planning permission at the moment , had a bit of a fight with that, so it’s been a bit of a problem but I think we’re making progress now but it’s taking a long time.

So can I ask what your first memory of the foot and mouth out break was?

Probably the reports on television of the outbreak in Devon and the link to the  farm on the North East.  My brother has a friend who is a farm manager over there and he was talking to him on the telephone and the lad that my brother went to college with over there, his farm was on the road up [EMPHASIS]  to the Heddon on the Wall farm.  They were saying there’s all this traffic going up and down the road past their farm and they didn’t know what was going on, it was when they were just investigating what had happened there [PAUSE]  because I know they were very worried because he’d been in and out of the yard all the time with the tractors and all the vehicles were going past up to the Heddon on the Wall.  Then when they found out what it was he was terrified that he’d taken it into his own farm.  He did eventually get foot and mouth but not at that point, it was more like a few weeks afterwards.  At that time, that’s my first memories that I have.

Can you remember what you were thinking and feeling?

I was thinking I hope it stays over there and doesn’t come over here, but within ten days or a fortnight it was in Longtown.  My first memory I have of it in this area was… I mean I know  Robbie X  quite well at S farm, which was the first one to get it. 

 That’s not too far from here is it? 

 No it’s only about two and half, three miles at the most.  I went to school with Robbie X; he was just a year older than me. We were at a plant sale, like a machinery sale, everybody was talking about it there but it had been confirmed at S [PAUSE]  and that was the first one. That was my first memory of it.  My first thoughts were that’s it, right in the area.   First thing I did was went straight to Longtown to the shop to get some disinfectant to wash the tractors and machines and everything.   

So the disinfectant, was that because the Government directed it or was that because you knew that was what you had to do?

Well people were starting to talk about it, everybody knew that disinfecting was the first thing to do, so everybody was saying it wasn’t easy to get because nobody had really been holding it in stock.  It's not the sort of thing they sold a great deal of at that time.  We couldn’t get any that day so we had to order some.  From that point we had about three weeks when we didn’t do anything, we didn’t move [PAUSE]   we didn’t want to.  Nobody wanted anybody on the farms at that point because it just snowballed round the area at that point.

So basically any kind of contract work had stopped?

Yes it did.  For about a good three weeks to a month we did nothing.  We weren’t too worried about that because we knew at least by that there was no way we could be spreading it or accused of spreading it or anything like that. 

But what about your income?

Yeh well it did, it stopped things completely but we were fortunate it didn’t [PAUSE],   because of the way the farming business works, you don’t get paid straight away of f of farmers so we still had money coming in during those three weeks and by that point again I’d started to earn again.  I think at that point A’s at Longtown, they actually rang me and they were starting the live sheep cull.  They were taking live sheep off the farm and taking them to the slaughterhouse at Carlisle and slaughtering them to try and help the spread of the disease.  So by that point, he was desperate for staff because the drivers of the lorries... because they were going back onto farms, they weren’t allowed to let the lorries in the slaughterhouse, so they needed somebody to wash and disinfect all the lorries.  So I got a team of men together to work, in fact the first day I went myself because I couldn’t get enough men, so that was earning me a suitable wage at the time, and then two or three days after that  the NFU contacted me and they wanted someone to go and help the army.  When the army were brought in they wanted somebody with local knowledge of the farms and the farmers and the countryside to help the army with getting settled in and dealing with the problems.

So that was sorting out the cull and the disposal of the carcasses?

Yes, like I say they wanted someone with local knowledge they like to be well organised, they like to know what’s going on so they wanted someone that had local knowledge of the area, so there was four of us.  They split Cumbria into four blocks and we each had an area and here Longtown that was my area.  There again that was helping me, I knew I was earning something but it was a long time before we got anything from that but at least I knew it was going to be there.

Was your brother involved in that as well? 

No, he does a relief-milking job every morning and he carried on with that.  The farmer were happy for him to carry on doing that. He weren’t operating anywhere else. So that kept him a basic income for a few weeks to a month, and then by that time, just because of the natural course of things, work had to start happening again and people had to start back again spreading slurry.  So he was back employed in that job again, so he carried on that side of it, and I was working in the operations room in Carlisle with the Army. 

With hindsight what was that experience like?

Well it was very worrying, it was terrifying, once you realised it was starting to spread.   I mean the first farm you think they will contain it and you think surely in this day and age with the technology you expect, you know you think it's not going to move, you expect them to  them to be able to control it, so it’s an initial shock when it’s right on your doorstep.  Like I say when Robbie X was confirmed at S [PAUSE]  and then the next one a neighbouring farm not too far, David G at L Hill was one of the next ones.  I mean  we know David quite  well,  we do quite a bit of work for them, and that was really horrendous carry on because there were a lot of animals and major problems because nobody knew what they were doing at the time.  David's actually brother in law to chap that my brother milks for  and my brother was talking to him on the phone so we sort of knew all the problems he was having. 

And was this problem with the time of diagnosis, the cull?

Yes, they slaughtered them quite quickly but they laid for nearly a fortnight in the buildings.  They were totally disorganised. They went in and they killed them just where they stood. Some where still in the cubicles, some were still near the feed barriers, and they said that they laid so long they were all blown up in the reports of what had happened. They couldn’t get them out of the sheds, it was terrible and then when they did come, a lot of the operators of the machines weren’t terribly professional I don’t think, they did rather a lot of damage to his farm.  I mean it’s all been put right since, it will have cost them a fortune to repair it but I mean David was on the television, he rang the television up he couldn’t cope with it.  He's got young daughters and the animals were lying.  You could see them from the kitchen windows.

This is the family that they offered hotel accommodation?

No I don’t think so, because at that point they weren’t allowing anybody to leave their farms once they’d been confirmed.  Within a week or so they seemed to change.  Later on they were letting people clean up and leave their properties if they wanted to go.

But this was quite early on?

Well it was about the second or third farm confirmed in this area.  Once they were confirmed, that was them confined to barracks for however long it took.   It took them [LONG PAUSE]   ten days to a fortnight before they even started to build his fire, then they made a mess of that, they couldn’t get it to light or to burn.  Yeh, horrendous time of it.   We were all thinking this is what’s going to happen, this is really taking off.  It was taking far too long, I mean Dad said In the outbreak of 67 it was all over and done with in 24 hours, they confirmed, killed them, they dug a hole and pushed them in, filled it in and that was it, that was the way they did it.  But then they decided they wanted to burn them all this time at the start, and   they were just completely not organised for it.  Then their thinking they’re going to contain this with this and all the disorganisation this isn't going to work which is exactly what happened, so it was very [EMPHASIS]   worrying for the first fortnight.  Because you think well this is a livestock farming area if there’s no livestock, which the way things were going at the time it looked as though we could be left with nothing or very little round about, this means there’s going to be no work for us, apart from psychological [damage?].  I mean it’s been bad enough this summer [PAUSE]   looking around at fields and seeing half of them being empty as it is when you’re use to seeing sheep and cattle in the fields all the time.

So in a way it affected not just your work but also your social life?

Well we never went out, we'd no social life, especially when I started to work in the office down there, we never went out we never went anywhere, I mean I was only in an office but from time to time we were [EMPHASIS]  visiting infected farms and the office was classed as a dirty site at the time so I don’t think that many people knew I was working down there.  You feel, I mean a lot of people that had foot and mouth at the start such as David G, you felt like lepers, you were shut off, you felt as though people didn’t want to associate with you, not because of you personally but because they knew of the consequences [PAUSE]  we felt a bit that way ourselves [EMPHASIS]  we didn’t go out we didn’t go anywhere.

Do you normally  have a bit of a social life? 

Well we try to but the business side of things doesn’t allow for it.  Winter times we can have a night or two but summer time it’s just impossible to have a night out at all, but that’s just our business it’s nothing to do with [PAUSE].

Can I ask about your wife S, does she have a farming background?

Her grandparents on both sides of the family were farmers, but her father's always just driven a lorry.         

But you both have friends in farming?

All are friends are farming and farming connected.  

So did you find because you couldn’t visit them ,
were you phoning?

Yes, you had to talk to somebody from time to time.  I mean       talking on the phone, myself I don’t like it, I’d rather go and see somebody, be it business or social I’d rather go and see them and talk to people face to face, I don’t really like talking on the phone, I don’t know why, but yeh, I mean it would drive you crackers if you didn’t talk to someone [LONG PAUSE].  The neighbours next door, they live just next door to us here, they farm, their farm is  about 100 yards down the road there and they’ve stayed clear all the time, they’ve managed to survive, but they come around every now and again.  About once a fortnight they come round for a drink and a crack and to catch up on local gossip and one thing and another.  They still kept coming round but I must admit I felt uncomfortable when they came, because of that fear.   Get foot and mouth and they’d been in our [EMPHASIS]    house.   But I mean they [EMPHASIS]  knew I was working down there.   But like I say, I had no contact, it was an office job basically, but it was just the fact that the site was classed as dirty.    ‘Dirty'/Clean'  was a major thing at that time.  

 The very word is quite loaded isn’t it? 

 Like I said, they [EMPHASIS]   were happy to come round here but like we never went round there.  If they want to come then well it’s up to them.  I mean it was highly unlikely but  like we don’t really know yet [EMPHASIS]  how it was spread and we knew even less at that stage.  

So how long did you work with the army?

Seven, eight weeks [PAUSE]   I could have been there a lot longer but [LONG PAUSE] sometime in  March   [LONG PAUSE] I think, anyway it was the day [EMPHASIS]  the army came, sometime in March when the NFU rang us and I got involved.  The only reason I stopped was because we were starting to get very busy at home.  The silaging work was starting and I needed to be at home because our [EMPHASIS]   work down there was a lot easier but it was a lot quieter mainly because the animals were being taken out by then.  There was very few of them left.  DEFRA were starting to take more control of that side of things.  I mean there were still cases at that point, especially in the Penrith Spur but not so much here. So our work at that point was mainly getting licences for people, stock moving licences  and licences for  people  such as myself to go on and off farms, that’s what our work was mainly turned into.  In fact there was five of us at that point, there was another lad joined us later on so that boosted us up to five.  But erh I’d say there was two of us that decided we were needed at home so that left 3 of them  to cope with the mainly licensing issues at that point.    

Which were quite a headache, weren’t they?

 A major headache at the start.  The organisation was the problem they just could not [EMPHASIS] cope with it.  The Government all of a sudden decided that we would have to have licences for everything and I just don’t [EMPHASIS]   think they realised how much work they were going to create, and of course there were no facilities to cope with it.  And of course everyone was ringing up wanting to move animals and not knowing what they needed. For the first fortnight to three weeks defining what licence different movements came under  was a big deal because there were so many different things involved, so that became a headache, so we were involved in trying to help Defra staff communicate with farmers, you know define things, sort things out, sort problems out, that kind of thing.  So it got to the point were there were a lot of welfare cases, desperately needing animals moved from the welfare point of view, but you couldn’t do it without a licence, but if they couldn’t get one, you couldn't do anything… that was quite difficult.  It was very upsetting.


So you’re talking there about feed and things like that?

Yeah

Were you putting in quite long days in the beginning?

Yeah, very long days [PAUSE]  Well, we were starting there about eight in the morning.  We had to go in at that time because there was a briefing every morning at eight thirty.  They would give out the figures and tell us what was happening.  I always tried to be on time for that.   It was usually eight or nine o clock at night before we were getting home and then you’d spend an hour or so maybe on the phone at night talking to people and helping to try and sort problems out.

These would be farmers, ringing you because they know you or because of your position in the army?

Yes, partly because of that.  Wanting Information on what they could or couldn’t do.  

So what was happening to you throughout this?  I mean you were working very long hours and your son is now 18 months so he must have been just a few months old.  Your wife works full time.  You must have been exhausted?

It didn’t really affect me too much, I was working on autopilot, we were quite use to it be quite honest with you. Those are the sorts of hours we put in the business anyway, especially at that time of year.  Silage time we are usually out about six in the morning and not back until midnight or so, so we were use to those sort of hours [PAUSE]   for different reasons obviously.  We were use to the pressure but for different reasons.   In the middle of silage time everybody wants you.  We were basically trying to do the same sort of thing, the principles were the same, you know, for what we were trying to achieve at the time but of course for completely different reasons and with completely different consequences.  So on that point of view I’m quite good at being able to switch myself off.  I coped by just trying to keep occupied, trying to do something to help really.  I think that made me [EMPHASIS]    feel a little bit better in myself because for that first week or two at the start you felt totally helpless.  We weren’t involved as in such that we didn’t have any animals so we weren’t a risk that way, so we couldn’t really feel what the farmers were going through, although it was affecting us, you know, from a work point of view, day to day.   So when we got the chance to get involved in trying to help somehow [PAUSE]   because we were all trying to fight the same cause.

But were you able to come home and sleep and eat and do those ordinary things?

It’s not a problem.  That’s not a problem for me.  Sleeping [PAUSE]  I probably had a few restless nights but I don’t need much sleep.  I think the busier I am and the less sleep I can get away with.  I’m fortunate that way.   

 I mean I know what you're saying and obviously with your business there where times when you were under a huge amount of pressure and you just dealt with it, but did you feel in control of what you where doing.  Did it make sense at the time?

No [PAUSE]  no not really.  I mean nobody [EMPHASIS]     was in control that was the problem at the time.  It was just a case of tunnel vision, trying to push forward and trying to achieve what we were asked.  Anything we were asked to do we’d do it, just get on with it, try and stop so many people going through the trauma that we’ve seen others going through.  Just trying to achieve [EMPHASIS]  something [LONG PAUSE].  There was just so much going on at the time and we were so busy and it was just…    we probably become a little bit blasé to what was happening because we were seeing it. I was seeing every case come through [PAUSE]   working in the office down there.   We were seeing every case.  Not necessarily blasé but probably more use to it because we were seeing every case come through and the markers going up on the board [in the army control room, marking the spread of the disease]. Each one then becomes not just as personal as the last one if you like, even though we knew the farmers, we knew the customers, friends, relatives and the lot, but it comes a point when you think, that’s another one, because there was so [EMPHASIS] many. 

You said that there were times when you had to visit IPs [infected premises]? Is that right?

We did at the beginning but the first [PAUSE] week to a fortnight we were busy protecting premises with the army.  I think the army came on the Thursday or the Friday and we started that afternoon on it.  The soldier that was in charge of this area, I mean he was an Officer, as we called him.  Each farm had his own liaison officer, and there was a liaison officer for the area.  I was working with the one for the area for the few days, because the offices weren’t set up at that point, we were working out of the back of the trucks in the car park.  We were just in a land rover with a list of names and going to visit them to see if there were any problems on the farms that had been slaughtered.

So did you witness the slaughter teams in operation?

No, I was there actually revisiting farms.  All the farms we visited were slaughtered when we got there.  To be quite honest I never actually saw an animal being put down.  I visited a lot of farms, we just went to the farm to see the farmer and talk to him basically.  There were probably a lot of people that saw a lot more than I did to be honest.

Those visits must have been difficult, because you might have known them.  What was that like?

Yes I knew most of them because they were all farmers in this area.
I knew them all.  Very difficult [PAUSE]    to walk onto the farm because you didn’t know what condition the farmer and his family were going to be in.    But I have to say, we were received quite well by all [EMPHASIS]     of them really.  No problems really.   Ninety percent of people I think they just realised that once the disease was confirmed, that’s what had to happen.  Major problems came thereafter when they weren’t getting the carcasses destroyed, that’s when the problems started.  Most [EMPHASIS]  people seemed to be able to resign themselves to the fact that their animals had to be slaughtered and so they didn’t complain, but they couldn’t cope with these animals lying about for days and weeks afterwards, it was always there in the yard and they couldn’t get away from it.

Was that just the sheer volume?

There just wasn’t the organisation.  Yes the sheer volume.  MAFF got terribly behind at the start.  Then by the time the army came…  I had no [EMPHASIS]  idea that things were in such a state until I went down there and I stated getting paper work with the numbers up.  The animals that had been slaughtered and the number of farms that had been affected, I had no idea it was even like as bad [EMPHASIS]    at that point.  There was a list as long as your arm with farms that were slaughtered but the animals were still there [EMPHASIS]  because there was nothing to burn them with.   Farmers were starting to get the idea themselves that it was being spread by the smoke from the fires, so nobody wanted a fire, and they were making such a mess of burning them anyway because they were using all the wrong materials.  It took weeks [EMPHASIS]  to burn.  They were using the wrong materials, they were trying to economise at the time, they were trying to save money.  

This is the coal story? 

Yes.  Well they were using power station coal, which is not as cheap, but it’s not as good a quality because it’s used to heat up the furnaces at the power station.  But to try and burn it out on an open field you need the best quality.

Talking about the pyres, what do you think about the idea of them spreading the infection?     

I don’t think it was them that were spreading it.  The infection was being spread from the animals that were still alive [PAUSE].  That’s more based on what I learned from working down there, but a lot of people still believe that.  I find it hard to believe it was spread that way when you talk to the vets and the ministry people.   People were thinking  [PAUSE]…one farmer [PAUSE] they would light a fire at one farm and two days later the next farm had foot and mouth, getting it off the smoke.  But that wasn’t the case because a week to a fortnight incubation period is needed, so the farm next door had probably picked it up from the loaders with animals that were still alive.  It’s just logical thinking, they lit that fire and two days later I got foot and mouth, well if the wind [EMPHASIS]   can blow the smoke into his next door neighbours the wind is also blowing the hair off his live cattle before they were slaughtered into his yard, you know.

There was a lot of fear as well wasn’t there?

Well they still don’t really know.  I mean there was a lot of cases they couldn’t explain how they got it and there were a lot of places where you couldn’t explain how they didn’t [EMPHASIS]  get it.  There were two farms on this road who hadn’t had foot and mouth.  Once they started to take the carcasses away rather than bury them on the farm, ninety percent of them came past this front door [EMPHASIS].  They all went to the airfield just across the way there, they all came in this way.  Every wagon probably came past here [PAUSE],  that was probably one of the worst things.  I think that was probably worse [EMPHASIS]  than actually working with it because when you came home of a night and started hearing the wagons, because they all came at night, it was one after the other, convoys [PAUSE]  twelve, fifteen wagons at a time.  They always worked at night time so you would just get home but you could never relax, you just had to try and relax a little bit then the wagons [EMPHASIS]    would start to come in.  

These are the S wagons?  

Yes.  

 Which everybody knew what they were about because they’re sealed aren’t they?

Well they’re supposed to be but there were some that weren’t, especially at the start there was a few problems.  

There were some that weren’t?  

Some wagons mistakes were made, lets put it that way. There were cows legs sticking out, I could see that.  There was no way they would let them leave the farms with that happening because you know what actually happens to an animal when it dies it blows up, so things start to move so… but it probably happened during transit, but those sort of thing were definitely happening.  It was that sort of thing that… when you saw a wagon go past and you knew [EMPHASIS]  it was carrying infected carcasses that was the sort of thing that always worries people.

And that happened for quite some time did it, the convoys?     
  
Yes, all the time [EMPHASIS], right up until the last  load that we knew of came from the last outbreak A town which was [TAPE INAUDIBLE] 

Towards the end of September?

Yeah I think so, they came to H

What do you feel about that, does it worry you in terms of where you live and the proximity of the site?

Erm no I mean l the fact that they had checked the site.  I meant it is a farm and he has stocked again. There's, there is about six hundred head of cattle down there now. So the diggers are in at the moment still putting things back together.  Everything is gone [EMPHASIS] [TAPE INAUDIBLE]  

What about the refuse tip at H Wood.  How do you feel about that?   

Well personally I didn't think they should be doing it but didn’t have much option.  The sheer volume, I don’t think anybody realised . In first week that the army came we shifted ninety seven thousand carcasses in the first week but they were still a long way behind.  Yeah in the first week.  They hadn't got up by a long way. There was still a lot of farms with animals lying around for days at a time.

Obviously there were a lot of protests? 

Yeah there were meetings at Longtown

Did you get to any of them?

I was asked to go but I decided to keep out of it because of my position down there.  The army over stepped the mark a little bit with that one.  Between the army and the farmer himself, the farmer at H is not a popular man as you can imagine.  He [EMPHASIS]   didn’t have any option and I [EMPHASIS] know that, because I was involved with the army when they set that up over night. It  was desperate at that point it really [EMPHASIS]   was desperate that day, I’ll not forget that day.  They hadn’t got the contract signed, to take that site over. It was a Saturday morning and they hadn’t got the contract signed until eleven o clock on a Saturday morning when the lorries were being loaded with the carcasses to go there because they had nowhere else for them to go that day.  Everything was crammed up, they didn’t know what the hell they were going to do that night if they hadn’t got that site that day.  They didn’t know where all these lorries were going to go. They were loading them that day but they didn’t know where they were taking them that night to park them up if they hadn’t got that signed on that day. 

Do you know why that site was chosen?

I think they needed something with that expansive area, so it had to be disused airfields that fitted the bill, the same at Great Orton .  At that point this was quite a central site to where the majority of the carcasses were.  There were a few farms on the outside edge of the infected area  they wouldn’t have wanted them bringing the carcasses out, this was in the middle, so the site fitted the bill, the access was quite good.

But that was in operation for quite some time?  Longer perhaps than anticipated?

No. they took  on the lease for twelve months.
 
Just going back In terms of the pyres, did that affect you personally, were you aware of them?

I was aware of the smoke.

What was that like?

It was terrible.  There’s nothing worse than the smell of burning flesh.  I remember that first week or two before, when we were just spending all our time in the yard preparing and it’s quite high up, it’s on top of the hill, you can see all the fires, all the carry on, nobody wanted the carry on, you could see all the smoke in the valley.  It was a terrible sight to see.  

Did the smell [of burning flesh]  affect you? 

After a while you sort of accept it.  There was talk of the toxins and the way it could affect our [EMPHASIS]   health.  It was continual, which is also a little bit worrying.    

Does that worry you now?

No not really.  I’m not a one for dwelling on things; it’s out of my control. If it’s something you can control yourself then fair enough but it’s out of most [EMPHASIS] people’s control.  There’s nothing you can do about it, if we’re affected by it or if it does affect us in the future there’s not a lot we can do.  If it’s going to happen it will happen whether you worry about it or you don’t.   It’s something that you think about from time to time.

Your son would be only six months when that was going on, did he suffer from coughs or sore throat at the time?

No, we weren’t affected.   Actually living here we didn’t get a lot of the smoke here, it was just the way the winds were at the time.  There was very [EMPHASIS] odd days when we were affected by it.  It didn’t really come this way, we got more of it when I was up at my parents place.    

How were your parents through out all of this, they must have been quite worried for you and your brother?

Well yes, they were worried about what was going to happen to our business and worried about their position because we sort of support them a little bit because my brother lives at home and looks after the property for them.  Me mother has a part time job in a shop, me Dad's retired.  We were all worried at the time.  We were just relieved that I could get something to do.  We desperately tried in the first week or two to try and to work with the tractors and machines just to help move the carcasses out into the pyres and this sort of thing but it was a closed shop, I couldn’t believe it.  We tried to get in with the bigger contractors such as Ms and Ken H and those people.  We tried to contract, we had the time and the machines, we don’t particularly want to have to do this type of work but if we can help and it’s going to help us make a living basically we will do it, but they wouldn’t take us on.   There was contractors such as ourselves that did [EMPHASIS]   get in eventually, I don’t know how [EMPHASIS]  they did because I mean I couldn’t even get in to get some of our machines on after I started to work down [EMPHASIS]    there with the DEFRA, MAFF as it was then,  people.  A lot of people said the same thing, people from all sorts of professions were offering help but it was being turned away.

So really it caused some divisions amongst the local work force?

Oh yes definitely.  There’s been so many changes and changed the course of many peoples lives I should imagine, apart from just the farmers a lot of other people.  I mean a lot of people lost their jobs over night.  It was worrying for us but we knew that we would find something [EMPHASIS],    I mean you have to.   When you own your own business you have got to find work.

When you were working with the army, did you ever feel that there was hostility towards you from local people?

No, I can’t say that [PAUSE].   No I never saw any evidence of that, but I was [EMPHASIS]    worried about that.   From a personal point of view I was worried about that.  From a professional point of view as well, if people decided they didn’t like what was happening, especially with this carry on at H  [FARM].  I was a bit worried at that point because people knew I was working down there and they expected me to have inside information which I didn’t have because I [EMPHASIS]    didn’t know this was going to happen, nobody [EMPHASIS]  knew this was going to happen, until [PAUSE]   there was a mention of it on the Thursday [PAUSE]  and things were getting tighter and tighter and tighter and on the Saturday morning, there was a big carry on that morning to get it organised because I think [EMPHASIS]   the rendering plant was shut down and they wouldn’t take anything that day because they were over capacity and they had to find somewhere to take everything from that day's slaughter, and just to try and catch up.  So I was very [EMPHASIS]   worried at that point as to whether people would take offence and the fact that they thought I knew more about this and I didn’t tell anybody.   I know when the neighbours were around one night, I said about this and I said, I hope people don’t think… because they were speaking to the neighbouring farmers more than I was.  I was trying to keep a low profile… I said I hope people weren’t thinking that I knew more than I did because I didn’t.  That as I say was very worrying at the time.  From a social point of view it could have ruined the business as well.  We depend on the local farmers and they could say, you didn’t really look after us when you had the chance to.  As I say, that was a worrying point.

But in spite of that your customers starting coming back?

Yes.

Did that reassure you?

Oh yes that helped a lot.  During the time the barbeque [large pyre burning] was on, then once they stopped that, that seemed to settle a lot of people locally, once they put that fear out.   Nobody was happy about all the carcasses coming in at once so that put a lot of people's mind at ease, not at rest, at ease. [Tape inaudible] 

Finally, what was the worst aspect of the foot and mouth outbreak for you?

[LONG PAUSE]    Just the sheer waste I think really. 

 Of the stock? 

 Of animals.  Such a lot of innocents shall we say, were slaughtered.  It was something [PAUSE]    because of the work that I was doing you realise it was the only way they were going to stop it.  At that point it had gone to far and that was the only thing you could do to try and alter the spread.   I think the worst image that sticks in my mind was the first day of the live [EMPHASIS]  sheep cull and I went to the slaughter house to help them un load their lorries and wash them out.   I’m not a lover of sheep, I was not a sheep farmer I was a dairy farmer.  So unloading the ewes or the feeding sheep as it were, the older sheep, took them [EMPHASIS]    to the slaughter house.  Well that’s not a lot different to what happens to them anyway, most of them, but the worst thing was when they started bringing trailer loads of new born lambs in.  That was terrible, we had to go in and unload them but it had [EMPHASIS]   to be done.   We unloaded the trailer and drove them into a pen and got out of there as quick as possible because you can hear them, the animals bleating as they were being herded up to be put down.  Absolutely Innocent young lives.  As I say, I’m not a lover of sheep by any means but those poor little things were only days old, they’d done nothing.  I think that’s probably one of the worst images [EMPHASIS] I have of that day. 

Does that come back to you sometimes?

It doesn’t come back as a regular thing [EMPHASIS]    but it does come up when you start to talk about it, like in this instance. I don’t get flashbacks or any thing like that.  Our next door farmer [Tape inaudible], he had foot and mouth and he’s getting his dairy cows back next week so he’s looking forward to that, so he still discusses things round the subject.  It will be another twelve months I should imagine before it’s all forgotten until everybody settles back into their routine again.   

Was there anything good that came out of foot and mouth for you?

[LONG PAUSE]   No I don’t think so. I mean we haven’t suffered financially really.  Physically, probably a little bit but there’s a hell [EMPHASIS]   of a lot more work this last year.  From a business point of view things are certainly up, they're not down.  There’s been a hell of a lot more work.   Mainly disinfecting.  So I’d not say we’ve suffered other than having to deal with what happened.  I can’t really say there was anything good to be quite honest with you.

How do you see the future?

The future.  Farmer’s attitudes and other people’s attitudes are a lot better now and the animals are back on the farms again, everything cleaned up.  I’m quite [EMPHASIS]   sure a lot of farms have benefited from it, I’m quite sure of that to be honest.  Certain amount of farmers were wondering where they were going to go, what they going to do to try and improve things.

But those that didn’t get compensation?

They just string along or either fall by the way side or they survive.  Those are the people that have been hit hardest by this [PAUSE]   financially anyway. You can’t take it way from the people who had to go through this.  Anybody you talk to say it’s very nice to have money.  A few farmers I’ve talked to quite openly say, financially it’s definitely helped us, we are in a lot better position financially than they were this time last year.  I haven’t spoken to one of them that said they wouldn’t rather have the animals that they had than take the money . 

And the breeding lines?  

There are odd people that have managed to trace breeding lines through people that have sold animals to them over the years, so they may get some of the blood lines back.  The majority of breeding lines they tend to stay in the same area, so there’s a good chance they were all taken out.  The future, well there’s going to be a lot of changes anyway [EMPHASIS].  The Government seem to be using this time to make a lot of changes in farming policy.    

[At this Point A went into details about the Government introducing new legislation that will affect how and when slurry is spread.  A is very concerned about this as it could have a drastic and negative impact on his business]


I asked A if he had anything to add and thanked him very much for his time.  We had been talking for well over an hour.

That’s alright yes, carry on

Going now

Tell you what would be helpful H, if you’d just say first what your normal job would be, when you weren’t working on the foot and mouth cull.

My normal job erm, prior to foot and mouth, (inaudible ) er, last fifteen years was driving tractors and combines, erm I was an estate manager until I got made redundant, five years ago and I bought my own tractor and erm I used to drop in with local contract lads and in the back end of the summer when the combiners start I would then drive combines for other people, which I’ve done for thirty years so, and I suppose the involvement or the reason I come to get involved in this was, that once Longtown, once it was established that Longtown had got the disease, and obviously they were tracing Longtown , and there was a trace went to Welshpool, well Welshpool’s Shropshire sort of thing, erm the minute Welshpool was found to, to have had sheep from Longtown which were contaminated or infected rather erm, then erm obviously all the restrictions came on round and about so then I couldn’t, I couldn’t do anything, the other thing obviously I’ve been involved in, I’ve been involved in shooting (inaudible) for forty years and the last twenty years I’ve,  I’ve actually been an instructor, actually an instructor as a profession, erm, so it was basically someone back home’s suggestion that could do with someone like me up here, ye know, and erm farming, shooting friends and I just rang up and, I suppose, lucky, I don’t know how you want to interpret it I just told em what I was about, and didn’t over emphasise anything, and er, they just said to me, they said you sound like just the sort of, man we’re looking for, and then two days later, they give me my first marksman’s job at High Hesket, yeah, High Hesket,
 (inaudible ) and it just went from there then.

And was that, were you brought in wherever they thought there would be difficult cattle, is that how it worked.

Yeah, initially, initially, initially my job, erm, I did that job and then they rang me then, cos I would surmise that, that the first job I had to do was, was actually take, to take two bulls out of thirty heifers, cos the farmer himself wouldn’t trust the bull, the heifers he could get back to the farm for slaughter but the bulls he wasn’t, he wasn’t happy about, so they took me in on the back of the pickup and he literally pointed them out to me and then I shot them out, erm, and then there was two more that had gone, that had been, that, that, whilst they were slaughtering two had jumped, one had gone round the quarry and, into a wood another one had gone across three fields, this sort of thing, and that was the sort of situation I was brought in for, anything that couldn’t be dealt with, anything that had escaped, or, lets say couldn’t be dealt with, it was dangerous, ye know, sort of thing, so that’s, that’s how I, now, having done that job, within about two days of doing that job, an, and it was successful.............well to perfection to  be quite truthful, well I suppose that the report came back in then from the field officer and that et cetera, and then I got a phone call asking if I could get a slaughter team, cos they were that desperate, and erm a friend of mine is a whip for the local hunt, in Shropshire, so I rang him up and I said, cos hunting had been stopped, the hunting fraternity had stopped it themselves, government didn’t stop it, so, they were twiddling their thumbs, so, his master said yes certainly, so Chris came up with me then, and we came to (inaudible 0) and he was with me for six, six weeks, so we were now a slaughter team, a two man slaughter team

So he was a licensed slaughterer,

Yes, yes that’s right, I, I mean I’d used a captive bolt many, many years ago, and so we were a licensed slaughter sorry we were ye know, a licensed slaughter, but we were a slaughter team stroke marksman, so we would get jobs where it would be difficult, difficulties, erm, I mean OK we did shoot when it wasn’t, when it wasn’t (inaudible) captive bolt although I did do a hundred and fifty nine shoots with the rifle that either couldn’t be gathered or had been left on a gather, or whatever (cough) excuse me, so, so that’s how we went on, erm, I suppose to be fair like when they’d had the sort out then these things just started to get a little bit more under control and there was people from, from I mean, from everywhere, and got things sorted, and then as things, as things went on and got a little bit more under control and they started to knock a lot of the slaughter teams off, and ye know, to be quite fair, we ended, we were the only slaughter team left from outside Cumbria, ye know, cos ye know, in fairness we’d earned, we earned our reputation, we were clean, tidy, total respect for the farmer, total respect for the, for the animals, cos I’d been in an estate manager so I know what it would be like to be in that situation, and I could, I’d worked within the farming community all my life so, I could appreciate the farmer’s side of it and then obviously Chris being the hunt servant, I mean, ye know they’re very smart and tidy, well mannered, an total respect for people so, we, we did actually do very very well, and were the only ones that were left outside of Cumbria, and then his master then decided he’d have to go back to the kennels, people have holidays et cetera, et cetera, and to which point then I thought well there’s probably, there’s probably, er, finish with me then but to my surprise they said absolutely no no we just want you to carry on just as you are, so then I, I carried on on my own,  erm strictly as a marksman stroke slaughterman, cos I’m licenced as well, for slaughtering, erm and erm I did in that period, in nine months I did a hundred and fifty farms myself, and with Chris, and ye know on top of that, there’d be two hundred (inaudible 061) and in that period I, this was (inaudible) I did four thousand five hundred and ninety eight cattle, a hundred and fifty nine sheep, and a hundred and fifty one pigs, and twenty one red deer that was (inaudible ) with Chris we did lamas (inaudible ) again we were sent because the jobs that, Chris and I used to get and, and certainly I, I always got, were,  they
were always very sensitive, I mean there was cases whereby it got to the state in the end where, erm I suppose sadly, I’d earned, earned myself a reputation, for having respect for the farmers and the cattle, and it got to the situation in the end where farmers were requesting that their cattle were taken out with a rifle I was asked to do it, I mean, there’s a training video of me taking out a hundred and forty five, dairy, ye know, it wasn’t just cattle that couldn’t be dealt with, cos, there’s no question, if you’ve seen, if you see slaughtered or captive bolt, and you see slaughter going on (inaudible ) 

The captive bolt, bolt they’d got to pith  them haven’t they, and its distressing I think, I can see that

And the problem, the problem is it doesn’t actually kill, its more of a stunner than a kill, and the idea of the pithing is to destroy the brain and the spinal cord system, where, whereas with the rifle its instant, and, and, I mean obviously, and in that period I mean, if you asked me, how many, how many I missed, an, out of that four and a half thousand I only missed five cattle clean, and I had to reshoot about five, half a dozen, sort of thing, so, and  I suppose, I suppose I was successful although its quite a feat to think of but er, I was the last, the last person to go because had anything, there is situations whereby the only thing, if, if an animal does go, and there, there’s no question there’s times when sadly there’s only one thing that’s going to catch it and that’s going to be a bullet cos nobody else’ll catch it, and erm, (inaudible 086) sort of thing, so that’s erm, that’s, that’s how it was I went and they did a training video of me taking out a hundred and forty five heifers(?), that was erm, that was actually done by DEFRA, or done for DEFRA I mean, obviously brought in, a, an outside film crew to do that, erm, and then at the end before I went, they actually asked me to, write, if I would write down, actually how I personally did the job, what weapons used, because it did appear to be the most success, it did appear to be the most successful, and also I was redeemed to be, and I suppose  erm, and again its not really the nicest sort of title to hold (inaudible ) but I mean its just (inaudible ) the DEFRA officials like I was the most experienced marksman in the country, for the slaughter of animals (inaudible ), so they had me write down, the idea of that being, hopefully, the same scenario we’ve had this time would not happen in twenty years, because if you actually took the, the video that they did, and put the, put the (inaudible ) marksman slaughter two thousand, Cumbria two thousand and one, if you put the two together the guidelines for, (inaudible ) if you put the two together, providing the person’s got the weapon, providing they’ve also got the talent, personality, character whatever it is, we’ll never want to (inaudible) I haven’t got that, because physically, get up, out and do the job and then an hour of reading and say this is actually, specific (?) this is actually how I did it.

Does that give you a feeling, I suppose, that you’ve got something positive out of it, that you’ve passed on that knowledge?

Well, yes, I mean erm, again they obviously realised that erm what I was doing was successful there was no question about that, but they did in fairness, and I did, they even had me doing two seminars to the vets that were actually were out on the sites, who were slaughtering and that was to educate them as to, what a marksman was about, when to use one, and couldn’t use one the more important, the dangers involved, cos, I’m afraid rifles don’t distinguish between man nor beast, it doesn’t make any difference, whatever’s in front they will kill, if it’s in the wrong spot, and so erm I actually took bullets in with me and went through the (inaudible ) that I used, and, I mean it was quite staggering when you turn round and say to someone, who had no knowledge whatsoever, of firearms, although they would, they’re calling you out, when you say to them, we’ll look at that thing there it’s good for three mile, and that one there it’s a bit bigger it’s good for five mile, and  ye know, they’re absolutely staggered, but to see it done properly there’s no danger whatsoever, to see it done properly by a professional person, you may feel anyone could do it but, but it’s the thought that has to go into it every time you pull the trigger, well I, I, how I used to erm, how I used to assess it, when I first started, they, the vet, who were on it, erm, they were actually doing the risk assessment, which was ludicrous because there’s not one of them, that was actual rifle orientated in any way shape or form, so they’d never fired a gun in their life and yet they were supposed to be doing the risk assessment, that they used for marksmen

For you going in?

Yeah, which was ludicrous because if, there isn’t a layman in any way shape or form qualified to, so anyway, erm, so  I mean, erm, so what happened then was Health and Safety, erm,  I actually did a job at Briscoe where there was eighty cattle that were out on, sucklers, a full suckler herd it was, calves as well, and erm, they penned them, they spent, they spent, they spent two hours .... in the evening trying to get these cattle in the pen, in a field, eventually they did, they actually bolted four of them, and then they just broke out, I’d gone down to take out two cattle that had got from the main holding, a cow and a calf, which were infected and I took them out (inaudible  and then whilst I was there just getting detoxed off they said there’s another one gone down the road, ye know, would you go there, so I said yes, so as I went down and as I was looking for this one the next, the next thing was there was the other erm, the other sort of, seventy six come and joined us, this was on a bank holiday Monday, this was on a Sunday evening this was, bank holiday Monday, they erm, they spent four and a half hours chasing them cattle round, and when I left that night I rang the, (inaudible ) I said they’re going to have some problems there cos they were going round like a herd, like a (inaudible ) just wandering, they’d just about a thirty acre field, just wandering round and I thought there’s no way, they’ll get them, so the following day about twelve o’clock (inaudible ) phonecall, can you go back to, ye know, and when I got there they’d never got them in again, they’d spent four and a half hours chasing them, and the problem was it was along the, right alongside the Carlisle to London line, so, the police, had to, had to get the, they called the police like because they’d been problems with,  with people trying to shoot cattle two two rifles and stuff like that and er, and so erm, the police had started to get involved and started to sort out these cowboys with their rifles, and er (inaudible ) and that police marksman to come and animals that hadn’t been shot clean had  escaped, ye know because of inexperience an, and lack of firepower as well, and the weapons they use, so then erm, er so the police turned up on site, they wanted to close the railway because it was right alongside the railway if one had broke onto the railway, there could have been problems, and I remember, I don’t remember whichever controls had (inaudible ) of the track, but they wanted two hundred and forty thousand for a half hour closure,  ye know it’s absolutely scandalous, so what was, so what was I directed to do, so I went across and there were two police officers, one being a traffice sergeant but also a firearm supporter so he was aware of firearms, two came down, so I walked across and just said to him well, (inaudible ) so that if I missed, the bullet was going to go nowhere except into the ground, and there was an area to the left that was (inaudible ) and there was a corner and there was a (inaudible ) in this corner and I said I’m going to take them out there and it was right by the railway, cos that’s where they were comfortable, comfortable, they’d decided that was where they wanted to be, at that particular time and day, they secret is to leave them where they are don’t try and move them to another part of the field, ‘cos that particular day that’s where they’re comfortable, but if need be, if I was going to have trouble with them, I mean its sound awful but it was a dire situation, I mean these were infected animals and they had been chased now for six and a half hours and still not been slaughtered, they’d also had a night in between and erm there was an area which was very boggy cos they were saying whatever you do don’t try and drop them, I mean a cat could walk through it, but it was about two foot it was just a boggy area, and if the worst scenario had come to the worst, I would have actually drove them into that, which they would have actually stood,

Yes

I know it sounds awful, but 

There was so much, yes

Exactly, yes, where they stood, and ye know, these were the sort of things, there’s no rules or regulations ye just have to take it as it comes, just use your own forethought, and erm, anyway I didn’t, I said to the police officer ye know, I don’t want to be too close, just, just go quietly and, there’s a drop onto them, we just, he said oh that’s grand (inaudible ) so what they did was, they, obviously they were in touch with, with immediate contact with British Rail or whatever it was Railtrack, so what they, so what was going to happen was, I was going to take them out where they were, the police were going to stop on site, we’d both got mobiles, he’d got my mobile I’d got his mobile, and then I would shoot between trains, as the train, as the train was coming cos you could see, I’d got vision, I’d got, I’d got Chris actually with me at the time so he was loading, and also he could keep an eye on the trains, and we saw a train coming we’d stop, the train passed we’d carry on, this is how we did it, and I gather the army were involved then, and we had an army landrover to come alongside and the idea was to just, not to push them, but just, just to hold them in that corner, so he got in alongside me he said (inaudible) don’t you (inaudible ) watch me, (inaudible ) driving (inaudible)1 you just watch me well they tended to back off and back off and come across and come across so that’s how er, just it was just holding them quietly and then I stood off them as we (inaudible ) instead of going in close to them, cos I knew if I’d have gone in close because the fact they were so, they’d been stressed with all the chasing, they were liable to go anywhere, but by standing off them, sort of a hundred metres, they were quite happy to stand there cos they, they didn’t feel threatened,and so that’s how I shot them out, of course Health and Safety were involved and this sort of thing, and fortunately it was, and absolute total, total success, and apart from six calves out of the eighty which were probably seventy, eighty metres from the main, (inaudible ) that’s, that’s the knowledge of knowing cattle, just going quietly, quietly at it, so after that then the Health and Safety erm started to get, me involved, putting together some legislation for marksmen, (inaudible ) what they’d got was actually, was a joke, erm and then they started to put together, wanted me to put together, the type of shots that I took, the critical thing about, with marksmen, is the one thing you cannot afford, the danger, most dangerous shot is not at this actually, its when the bullet exits the animal, cos you’ve got no control over it, I can control this, but I can’t control a bullet coming out of, out of an animal, cos I don’t know where it’s going to come out and I don’t know which direction it’s going to go

Why, because it might glance off a…… 

What happens is, if you, a standard sporting shot, within obviously the nearest thing is, is deerstalking, culling a deer is the nearest thing you can get to, to shooting animals of that nature in this country, and erm, the standard shot for stalkers is a heart and lung shot which is just behind the front leg, now the problem is the power of rifle that has to be used on, on a deer, it will never hold the bullet, the bullet will always exit the other side of the animal, but if you, but obviously deerstalking takes place usually in, wooded, very much open situations, where there’s less risk of anyone getting hurt, whereas this, this situation I was shooting in the (inaudible ) because you’d no choice, it had, they had to be taken out, but the problem is if you heart and lung shoot and animal it doesn’t, necessarily, always, erm always drop dead, even though you may have put a hole through the heart and the lungs, until the blood comes out they will still keep going, and that’s the way to describe it, that’s what it’s like, if your engine blows up on the motorway, it doesn’t stop then it goes half a mile before it er, before it stops, that’s er, that’s exactly how it works with cattle and public perception is, I personally could not stand that erm, scenario. with me, I mean when I shot they had to go down, and they had to stop down, so I never, only on two occasions, in four and a half thousand, ever, only shot two heart and lung, the reasons for that was, what, there was one that was left and it wouldn’t stop running, and I said to the vet, I’m going to have, to have to stop it, cos obviously again, an infected animal, couldn’t take the chance of it jumping out, and so I, I heart and lung shot it, on the run, it went down onto its knees, whereby in two seconds I was there and put another bullet, so that was, that was er, that was one of them and the other was a similar situation, one that had escaped into a woodland and it was, well, they could have lost it forever, sort of thing, and that was another situation, but erm, the problem is with that shot, is if you strike a bone, if you don’t put your bullet right, if you strike a bone then it will turn in the animal, and it can actually come out the spine, out, the far side of the stomach, it, ye, you just haven’t a clue, so they, so they realised that this was another, these were all the dangers, cos they started talking to me more then about, Health and Safety had me in, er, sort of thing, and how it was done, so erm, they started bringing some legislation, as to what particular shots sort of thing.

So they’ve been using you as a consultant really?

Yes

(inaudible)

But not a paid one,

Oh really

No, no, no, no, the (inaudible) say now this erm, these guidelines, this is (inaudible ) about twenty pages, erm and I’ve tried to see if I can get the copyrights on it, cos if no-one else can write it, only me, cos it’s only me as knows how I did it, and I dare say that the government being the government (inaudible ) if I do get them, cos there was talk of them, they went to slaughter, humane slaughter society, and er, also the, they video’d it, (inaudible ) there was talk of it actually going to colleges, farming agricultural colleges and veterinary colleges because the idea is, I mean if I, the idea is to, is to erm, educate the next generation of farmers, of what the options are in this situation, and how it can be done if it’s done properly, so erm, yes, I did that, I did two seminars for the vets and then had me do a presentation to a hundred, hundred and thirty (inaudible ) a hundred and thirty field officers at the Shepherd’s Inn, Carlisle which I took my rifles, and they, the ammunition is actually dud, although it looks live to anyone, but it is actually dud, (inaudible ) et cetera, cannot be fired, erm, so, ye know, we basically went through the weapons, which was used for what, sort of thing, and again educate them as to what bullets, because the field officers, the field officers were, to the latter, they were there to ensure the carcasses were gone, so we had to work with them, so we had to work with them, ‘cos it’s no good me shooting cattle out in, in a building, and then they couldn’t get a loadall in, but being a farming background myself, I mean, I knew straight way, looked straight away, can get a loadall in here, no problem, ye know, so it was (inaudible ) and erm then they were also, early on and pretty well through they were involved ensuring everyone was detoxed and, sort of thing, so erm, again it was like, I also used them occasionally on road closures, ye know, only on minor road closure as opposed to (inaudible )

When, you were obviously working on the infected farms a lot, were you living here then, was that alright, or did you have to go and live somewhere else,

You mean here?

Mmm

No, no, I was actually, whilst I was working for, whilst I was working DEFRA erm, I was based in the hotel in (inaudible) 

Oh right yes, yes that’s right, mmm

I was there for nine months, nearly ten months in the same hotel, same room, ha ha, yeah, (inaudible) erm, and again see, there was things like that you had to think about, erm, I’m on an infected premises which I was on the farm I’d have to have clean clothes on every day, sort of thing, so that you weren’t. . .

Mmm

Ye know, it was a lot you had to think about, and obviously the biggest one was the dangers of the, of the actual job you were carrying out,

Yes, when you were describing the incident by the railway line and what happened there, that sounds like a very tense, complex situation.

It was, it was

Was that very exhausting, you know, if you were doing that day after day?

Well I did

Must have been mentally taxing.

It was, yeah, erm, aye it was because erm, again I suppose because I was, I was successful because ye know, I like to be totally conscientious, erm, I’m always thinking about it, and hence I suppose I always (inaudible) for these people to shoot, (inaudible ) I’m totally aware of all the dangers and that, and I mean, the pressures, er, I mean some weren’t quite as bad a others but I mean on that particular one, I mean that, I mean that was a major incident that was, because the fact they could not pen the animals, under no circumstances, there was only way them animals could be slaughtered and that was with a rifle, it was, in fact it was the get out for them,

Mmm, I think you’ve got a lot of variables there as well haven’t you, with the railway line

Absolutely, yeah, and ye know, on top of that you’ve two, the two police officers, they weren’t a problem, they were great, I mean, I’d always got on very well with the police, because I did used to keep contact with the police, erm, and erm, I mean there was twenty wagon drivers there, loadall drivers, oh, I mean, ye know so, an they’re all standing watching, ye know, cos I mean, I know, it’s not a sporting situation but I mean I suppose it is such a unique situation, but erm, err, I mean people, public being what they are, people being what they are, they’ve got to see it

Well, its something we’re not used to in this country, unless you are part of the shooting fraternity you don’t see cattle culled.

Well, you never see anything like that, on that sort of scale I mean, I mean you’re talking about, I mean to the farmer this is what, this is what erm frustrates me a little bit with the, with the, public perception of all this, er, how they dismiss the farmer, well they’re going to be slaughtered anyway, and all of that sort of situation, but what they don’t realise is erm, to most of the farmers, most farmers, they are the cat and dog, and Joe public (inaudible) in the street, they don’t see it as that like, but that is, that is a fact, (inaudible ) had this dicussion with them, okey yeah that farmer knows that when that animal gets to eighteen months it’ll go into the food chain, but he has done his job, that is going to earn him his living sort of thing, but I said you go and try and hurt that animal (inaudible) before that time is ready, and boy he’ll, he lift you straight off that (inaudible ) no question, you go and try and hurt that animal, prior to that eighteen month period, and to try and tell Joe public that they just, look at you like you’ve grown horns or something ha, ha, but erm

You said that you were often having to go in to sensitive situations, were you actually having to deal with the emotions?

Yeah, totally

You were, you weren’t able to keep your distance (inaudible )

No, no ................because it was so unique, you hadn’t got anybody but anybody, that could, that could actually, physically give you any advice, or any help whatsoever,

Mmm, mmm

There’s nobody in the country that was qualified in the situation in hand, with the use of a rifle for slaughtering, animals, ‘cos you’re forgetting your stalkers and all this sort of situation because we’re not talking about a stalking situation, we’re talking about the slaughter of animals, as quickly, as cleaning and as humanely as possible, and that is what the job in hand was nothing more nothing less, and so, when you would go on to a site when they thought it was going to be easier, safer and quicker to cull, in myself, then I would ring, ring in and ask, they’d have a look around, right, and when I got there, all, what, what would happen then was, I would go round with the vet, if the farmer could deal with it, I’d go round with the vet and the farmer, look at what, there was,

Mmm

Look at the situation they were in, and then I would have to make the assessment, getting in the loader or whatever, if you miss, is it going to go through the wall of the building, what was behind it and all this sort of thing, and so you were totally, totally, on, I was totally on my own, absolutely, on that aspect of it because there was nobody that was got the experience or knowledge, of anything that I was doing, and then on top of that you’ve got the farmer then, who, could or couldn’t deal with it, I mean some of them, some of them, I mean some of them (inaudible ) to see like a seventy year old man (inaudible) ye know when you’ve got to go and shoot his four prize bulls, ye know sort of thing, I mean its, but you had to deal with it, you had to deal it, and erm, I don’t know, ye just, erm people find it fascinating to know me even round here, er how I could do it and I don’t know what, I always say its, ye know personality and your character, erm, but er ye know, but the biggest advantage was I had total respect for the farmer, total respect for the animals so, but its erm ......I don’t know really what..

Did any of that stay with you, do you still think about or were you able to leave it behind with the job as it were?

I mean I’ll never forget obviously, I never, never forget it, I mean you just couldn’t, erm, because I mean, it was normally abnormal, unique, what, however one wants to interpret it, what I did for nine months, erm... it doesn’t trouble me, it doesn’t trouble me, I don’t (inaudible) they never have troubled me or anything like and that doesn’t mean, erm, (inaudible) for what I’ve done, a job I had to do, er because it doesn’t, I mean it, its, the fact that I get on so well with people up here etc, that er, I’ve wanted to stop here, it’s as simple as that, so, erm, and every job I went on, erm, fortunately, everyone was a complete success, I did not have any, failures, I didn’t have any cattle escaping, I didn’t have any cattle running around, running around, it was, any missed shots I mean ye know, some of the stories were horrendous (inaudible) what happened, but I was fortunate whatever, erm so, no, I mean its, its certainly not affected me, erm..

Do you think it did at the time I mean you talked about feeling very tired afterwards, did it. . . . . 

. . . ..Oh, er mentally, mentally. . .. . 

. . .. . . affect your sleeping or your eating or drinking, that sort of thing?

No, no, no no it didn’t, didn’t, but the mental erm the metal stress or (inaudible) the stress that was related to it, ye know and the mental tiredness (inaudible) I mean sometimes, I mean if you had to shoot two hundred cattle, see the thing is once you, ye know if you’ve got two hundred cattle to shoot, you have to put the same effort into the two hundredth shot as you do into the first shot, but that two hundredth shot might be six hours down the line from the first shot, ye know, and that’s, I mean the farmer demands that respect.. ye know, and the fatigue, and the stress, and the concentrate, the concentration was the killer, every time, ‘cos you’ve only one single bullet and to put that in that two inch target, or inch target whatever part of a head you were shooting at, ye know, two hundred times, and not miss, it’s fantastic the concentration you need, I mean, I, I, I didn’t, I think more about it now, ye know, I sometimes think how the hell did you, ye know, how did you did you go, how, how did you hold it together, ye know ‘cos the concentration is phenomenal, not so much the stress it was the concentration was the killer, I mean sometimes your come, if you’re coming back from say Kirkby Stephen say, coming back to (inaudible) maybe nine o’clock at night and I didn’t think I was going to make the hotel, I thought I was going to have to pull up on a layby, I was that, shattered, purely from exhaustion and concentration

And then you might be called out the next day?

Oh, would be the next day, no, that’s, no, no, seven days, in the nine month, ten month I only had, I think I only had eight days off, in that period, yeah, it was, and then, then you got that really you had, you had the situation whereby, that was a very sensitive job (inaudible) or shock or (inaudible) people involved in London, up here, Carlisle (inaudible) it was a very sensitive job, he wouldn’t let, he wouldn’t let his cattle down, and I’d already in the beginning of the week or middle of the week had to go and take out fourteen cattle of this farmers, which were actually across the road from the main farm, and six of them were infected, (inaudible) and I shot them out, because they then decided they were going to have to take his main farm because he’d been shepherding these cattle, been back and to, so it was obvious, like it was a risk to have left them but he didn’t think so, and so erm, (inaudible) all sorts of aggravation, threatened vets that he would come around and shoot them, all this sort of thing and the police (inaudible) calm him down and then, erm DEFRA legal team involved in London,  (inaudible  Carlisle and (inaudible) and then, and then someone obviously must have talked him round and decided that eventually he would let them go .... but, every one had to be shot in situ with the rifle (inaudible) I was unaware of all this, it was just another job, there was a thousand sheep and two hundred and fifty cattle, a dairy farm, and, sheep and dairy, so when I got there in the morning (inaudible) etc cleaned the eye sight etceteras when I got there the slaughter team were there and erm they, they said to me, hey pressures on you today H, so I said why is that, I knew all the slaughter lads ‘cos they travelled round them all when they were in trouble, well you’ve got cattle to do, I said aye how many is there, oh he said only about two hundred and fifty, we can’t touch ‘em, we can’t go anywhere near ‘em, all we’re doing is the sheep, so then, so then, it started to come out then, all this, so then erm everyone had been handpicked for the job, slaughter team, team of officers, vets, all been hand picked for the job, and they, the criteria was, it doesn’t matter how long it takes, it doesn’t matter what you need, the job has got to be done properly, (inaudible) Carlisle, and at nine o’clock there was eighteen eight wheelers, there was three loadalls, two detox units, everything was on site at nine o’clock, and nobody came on site, the instruction was that no one went on site until they were requested to come on, ye know and I knew nothing about this, so anyway, the vet says to me (inaudible) because I always spent, actually shot with the vehicle a lot of times, that was the secret behind it, so (inaudible) went down this long drive and, (inaudible)  come on H have a cup of tea and do the valuing and all that sort of thing and, I got on great with him, farm orientated we speak the same language, he was also a bit of a shooter and, we hit it off like that, but I, there was a little bit more that I didn’t know, so, anyway after all this was sorted and that, right going to get the sheep in, so Roy said, you alright H, yeah no problem, no, whenever you’re ready, he’d been round with his lad Joe, been round the night before, (inaudible) every animal on the farm, the night before like, ye know, none had stopped that night, so I’d given them a hand to get the sheep in and there was fourteen missing (inaudible) chasing and pushing (inaudible )

END OF SIDE ONE

I said come on I said, show me these bulls, he’d got forty bulls, and she started to, she broke down a little bit she wasn’t too bad, and I put my arm round her and (inaudible) sort of thing and, remember you’re not on your own in this, and she come round like, (inaudible)  and they’re here, so I mean they’re coming to you  (inaudible) explaining to her and ye know and she, ye know and she come round like, and that was the psychological side that you have to deal with, that was as hard if anything (inaudible) and then when they come back then said right, and I said oh that’s excellent, I said look I’ll have to ask you to stand sort of outside because of the (inaudible) big massive feed passage way and then bulls on either side I said just hold em in there, just hold em in there, yeah no bother, and just there, we’ll get em in the loadall, and they sat on the wall outside (inaudible) everything that’s going on, and he said to me take them big ones out first H, he said those are bulls, and so I shot these out, an there was like maybe ten in a pen, lovely cattle, anyway I shot them out, and then (inaudible) they’d got a Pyrenean mountain dog that was absolutely petrified of loud noises, so they’d sedated the dog, I said what yer going to do, they’d sedated the dog so the, they said right I’ll tell you what I’ll take out this first pen of bulls and then we’ll go and check on the wife and the dog,

Is that one of those big white, like a polar bear?

Yeah, that’s it... so right, so anyway, I shot these ten out, he come in, this lad (inaudible) he wasn’t fiery, he was on the balance, he was absolutely on the balance, he was, and I went on to do (inaudible ) he was on the balance and one wrong move and you don’t know which way it would have gone ye know what I mean, it was just like a balance, anyway I shot these ten bulls and he watched me, just quietly, and he come and said I don’t believe H (inaudible ) he said well, he said there was no one else going to shoot these cattle, only you, he said, your the best (inaudible )  your the best in the country, and I’m getting all these accolades, like sort of thing, which is nice, but not when I’ve got another two hundred cattle to shoot ha, ha, ye know, so it was pressure you could have done without,  and then, so anyway, we saw that the dog was alright and his wife was alright and I said where do you want to start now, and he said oh, you start where you like, ye know, so it was all to, all round him, how do you, any particular ones, etc etc and we just went round them, (inaudible ) he couldn’t believe it, the thing that got me more than anything was, whilst I was slaughtering them, and they, and he’s right and I know myself, when you’ve got bulls, bulls, young bulls, the minute a stranger goes they start roaring, they know.

Yeah

And they (roaring noise) like a roaring sort of thing, they know there’s a strange person around, and what, what he could not get over, I shot these forty cattle and not a murmur whilst I was shooting them, before I shot them, not a murmur and he couldn’t believe it, like I was a complete stranger in there.

Were you in your vehicle at the time?

No, no, no

No, you actually, you were in the building

No I was in the building with them, in the building, there was a feed passage through the middle and pens either side.

Yeah, yeah

And he couldn’t believe, he could not believe that, how they never made a sound, like the way no roaring no nothing, and then once we’d done that then we had to stop for lunch, should we stop for lunch H, well I said, it’s entirely up to you, oh yeah if you want to stop for lunch like sort of thing, ye know whatever, so we had a sandwich outside and cuppa tea, and then, both of them jumped in my jeep, in the back, we’re going now out into the field, and then they went and, they brought them, the milk cows had come in in the morning, milked turned back out and then they were, they shot where they were lying or where (inaudible) were dry cows and we had to come back, we had to come back  from one side of the farm to the other, we had to go to the opposite, (inaudible) dry cows, and at one stage I got, his own vet, not the vet that was there ye know in charge, his own vet, the vet (inaudible) his son, the man himself and his wife sat on his knee and they watched me shoot every single animal.

It’s an extraordinary position to be in isn’t it?

It’s different

For you, my goodness

I could handle it, why, I don’t know why, (inaudible) I could handle it, I could handle it, I had to, because the last thing that (inaudible ) to fall down, or lose it

And like you said you had to do it his way

Well, it wasn’t a matter,  no, it wasn’t a matter of having to do it his way, I mean  no one, probably a vet, no, I mean I did it, how I felt was the best way to do it, ye know what I mean, and he was totally, absolutely whatever, no once I did it his way, I’d fit it in with light, where do we want to go first Tim, right H, do you want me to start with these bulls, yeah, lets get these bulls out of the way first, (inaudible) where do you want to go now, right, we’ll do milk cows now H, ye know, it was, when I say that , no, no I did it totally, my way, because ye know with all the greatest respect to him, there’s only me knew the safest, ye know from the humane side of it

But you let him feel as if he has some say in it

I did it, I did it in order of merit that he wanted it doing, whichever ones he wanted doing next, I fitted in with him, but I had to take control of the actual shooting because it was me that was actually pulling the trigger, but I mean, ye know apart from that, and that how we went round until we’d finished the (inaudible) and erm an’ it’s sad like I mean, the biggest thing that brought it home to myself was, it still does when I think about, was erm, I had to go in and have a cuppa tea, erm, myself and the vet, and they wanted us to have some supper with them, and we couldn’t because the detox was at the end of the gate, and the sort of legislation was put down was no vehicle was allowed to come off and be detoxed in the dark because it could be detoxed off (inaudible) so we had to come away and it was, because it was getting on towards dark, sort of thing,  and he shook  my hand and he, he said you’ve been fantastic (inaudible) he said you were an absolute professional, ye know, (inaudible ye know, and I said how can you say that, and (inaudible)  so, I mean that was, that’s the biggest kick.

Yes

Ye know, and done something like that (inaudible) sort of thing and, ye know he couldn’t thank me enough (inaudible ) a lot of pressure at times, and I always got that sort of job, ‘cos I (inaudible)  sensitive (inaudible) I dunno, I wasn’t insensitive, sensitive to the situation, I understood the situation, the (inaudible ) ‘cos once it came back, given reports like that, I mean, to be fair to erm A, when I saw him towards the latter, before I finished, erm, (inaudible) we spent five minutes in his office he started embarrassing, praising me for what I’d done for Cumbria and the farmers and how professional I was, an, the best bit I enjoyed was the fact that (inaudible) reports from the farmers, passed the glowing reports (inaudible) were incredible, an’ that was the best bit, because it was, it was their cattle, that I was actually taking out, ye know, that was the most erm, that was the bit that was most (inaudible) was the fact that the farmers, were satisfied, ye know, didn’t worry about the vets or anyone else, because it wasn’t their cattle at the end of the day, it was their livelihood, (inaudible)

How about the future?

Ha, ha I don’t know, well the future says in that report, that we do, that they should, should, have a list of marksmen, that should be put together, put round colleges, (inaudible) and have, have something sorted like that, I mean, I did, even suggest to them whilst everything was still in everyone’s mind, that erm, ‘cos I know what’ll happen, somewhere along the line, that report will go to the colleges and that video will go to the colleges, and there’ll be some pillock, for want of a better expression, lecturer or something, probably never been on a slaughter in his life, will watch, read that and this is how they do it, and I said it seems a shame that the opportunity would be missed, because not only have you got the man still around who was involved in the video, and actually wrote, the guidelines, erm, who better could you have, than to go round to the colleges, and the, and I’ve got the weapons to show, ye know what I mean, and surely that has to be, has to be a way forward, (inaudible) typical, typical of the government, (inaudible ) whether they will ever do anything right, I mean they took no notice of sixty eight, and will they’ll do the same again, I don’t know whether they’ll quite do the same again, but erm, so the future, erm, I’ve actually started work, something I haven’t done for twelve months what one would term a proper job, ha ha, I don’t think what term what I was doing would be a proper, so I’ve actually started work and doing a proper job at the moment, which I’ve been doing this couple of week, and that’s a start we’re get back into the world, erm

Is that in agriculture as well?

No it’s not, actually, it’s not, it’s not,

Well, you don’t need to tell me, it’s alright

No it’s, it’s not actually, erm, erm, so what I’m looking to do now is erm, Health and Safety because of the (inaudible) seminars, I’d like to get involved with something like that (inaudible) erm certainly within that area, so what I’m looking for now, I’m looking to try and get into something within the (inaudible ) centre I mean (inaudible ) anything that’s dealing with farmers, because that’s sort of what I’m in to, erm, like National Trust, Forestry Commission, erm..... Lake District National Parks something like that, I like, ‘cos I am like sort of (inaudible) and er, ye know, see if I can put my talents to some other use, but within that same sort of environment, ye know ‘cos I mean even within the countryside erm, erm, ye have to try and keep a balance of nature haven’t you

If you were asked to do something like this again would you do it?................I suppose I mean would you have done it if you had know what you were getting into?

Yeah, mmm, providing, providing, I feel I’d got the ability and the confidence to do it, you can do it, and I mean obviously I can say that now, with conviction, because I’ve done it, erm, I’m very good, very good at focusing and that’s exactly what you have to do,

Mmm

You have to be totally focussed and all I ever saw was (inaudible ) away was the cattle in front of me, whether there was two hundred people there, er, or where ever I didn’t see them, all I saw were the cattle in front of me, and that was the, I suppose, again one of secrets I could focus, I didn’t need the ego trip to see who was watching or nothing like that, I’d got a job to do, decide what it was, I’ve got to take them cattle out and once I got there that was it, everything, just total focus

Yeah

(inaudible) I don’t know  a situation like, whereby the nature, having abled me, you’re able to do it, ye know,............

It sounds to me compared with some of the other people involved with foot and mouth, as though you maybe felt, you had more control over what you were doing.  Maybe that has helped, do you think?

I had to take control, I, because what I was doing, what I, I could not afford to let idiots or imbeciles, control me, with the type of weaponry that I was using, I had to, in the nicest possible of saying that, in the nicest possible way I had to, because, like I say, the bullet once it goes, it doesn’t distinguish between man nor beast and so I had to take control, because the problem is, okay I could,
I could have just said oh well what do you want me to do, and the vet, TVI, they were in sole charge of the job, overall, everybody, field officers, detox, gatemen, you name it, there was only person in charge, on any slaughter site and that was the DEFRA vet ... but the problem was they hadn’t a clue themselves, when it come to my job they hadn’t a clue, and so I could have just turned round and said what do you want me to do, or where are they, oh aye ye know you want to shoot them there or, ye know, its too dangerous what I was doing, and because I’m conscientous, and as I say focused on what I’m doing, erm, er in a sense I had to take charge because I mean the vet’s not going to take responsibility if I shot someone, they’re not going to lock the vet up, cart him away, are they, I was the one that pulled the trigger, ye know, so I had to take the responsibility, an’ I must, I’m capable of, that’s the other point, ye know, sensibly, without ye know, going on, being loud, (inaudible) got to be, ye have to be sensible, logical and practical about it, ye know sort of thing, because of the work, (inaudible) I mean I had a cow to shoot in, in Longtown, (inaudible) they’d had it in four times, (inaudible) it had been round the village about four times, and there was a panic phone call, and I was here, and had a fair chase up to there, and they’d got everything slaughtered bar this cow, and she’d been, I dunno where, anyway she turned up, in a field just down the road, right in the village, and there was half a mile of houses on one side and there was houses on the top side of her, there’s a road running behind it, there’s the main road coming to Abbeytown which is (inaudible) she never moved for an hour he said, and we got (inaudible) and he said, that’s the, that’s the closest she’s been H, she about two three hundred metres, from the road, and, all the slaughter team were all there ‘cos they’d, they’d all finished now like, and all the wagon drivers were all lined they couldn’t do anything ‘til this cow had gone because there was concerned of it going again, so he said what you, he said I don’t know how you’re going to get, to it, and I said to him, I said well, just hang on a minute, got my rifle out, said when I tell you just open that gate, close the gate behind me and don’t stand at the gate, keep out of sight, because if they see people that’s when they go, and so she was positioned right, with the main Abbeytown road coming right into her, she was stood right with the road at the back of her like, two hundred yards behind her, and there was a road going across behind her that way, and a farm on the left, so I just had to weigh it up, weigh (inaudible) so I came out of the field just very, very slowly I mean I wasn’t going as fast as you would crawl, just ticking over and then I came and put a ....(inaudible) and got the main road to Abbeytown at two o’clock, and I got the farm on the left at ten o’clock, and I got her sat in the middle at twelve o’clock, but, there was a road behind her, so I just came in and when I, she started to stretch her neck I knew then, she was starting to get worried, and that would be (inaudible) and then I just dropped the rifle and (inaudible ) and waited and a car passed and that was it, it literally took me about three or four minutes, like, you know, but I mean there was all these houses all around watching you, so I mean the pressure

To have these very complex

The pressure

Yeah

So you had to think for yourself, totally, and the pressure on, on that in particular, ye know, I mean can you imagine, if I hadn’t killed her clean, if she’d have run off, with a bullet in her, I couldn’t afford to miss, (inaudible) and there was the rotten situation like that where I couldn’t miss, I could not afford to miss

Has it been strange leaving that behind you?

Oh yeah

Leaving that degree of responsibility and. . . .

Urm, yeah

Adrenalin if you will
Yeah, I mean, it, .....I mean it is, because I mean,.........well.......just, just... I dunno, (inaudible) I mean how many people have done that in their life, it’s, it’s,..... it’s I mean nothing can (inaudible ) I mean it’s, it’s, it’s a, was a different thing, and ye see, ‘cos one hand, on the one hand it wasn’t a nice job, ........ye know, it was a job it had to be done, and sadly as I say, ye know, it seems strange me putting it like this, but I mean, I was successful at it...

Yeah

Totally successful,...........erm and in actual fact when, I wrote this, ye know, these guidelines or whatever (inaudible) and there was a TVI (Temporary Veterinary Inspector) worked on with me, ‘cos he put bits and pieces in, and, the type of personnel that you require, and ye know, everything (inaudible ) put down the type of personnel, character, and when I read it he’d basically put down my character ha, ha, but then I’d worked with him a few times and in fact the job I was telling you about with the wife and, and the son coming with me, I mean, he was actually the TVI that had handpicked (inaudible) and he actually wrote down, and when he read it, ha ha it was my character and personality, just put on paper how I am ye know sort of thing, and, no I mean, yeah,  I mean it was strange after, it was strange after nine or ten months of doing that like, but I mean it got, I mean it got to the situation I suppose, erm, where, it, ye know, it really did become a job, but it was a job with a difference in so much as you were dealing with people, ye know, ye’d deal with people where their emotions were running, very, very high, no control, at times, and then you’ve got, you’d also got, like two, I never real, I hadn’t initially, occasionally I tell, and total aggression, oh I mean you get it wrong lad and I’ll bloody shoot you, and the language, the language was a bit stronger than that, erm, I had one or two situations like that, but I always won, I always won, because ye know, I, got it right, and the by the time I came out, I mean, ye know they thought it was fantastic, but an hour, two hours before, what he wasn’t going to do to me, ye know was not worth, it made you wonder what the hell am I doing this for sort of thing, but er, ye know, (inaudible) erm, so yeah, it was strange like, strange after doing it for so long, but I mean I, I mean I’ve got back into it now, I mean in a sense, (inaudible) I suppose the thing is I can talk about it, I mean, I ye know, you do have some giggles, that is the secret, okay away from it, it’ll never happen on the day, it’s always the day after, or the night after, I mean I, I had a, pigs are difficult but er, Gloucestershire pigs, I mean although they’re most intelligent of, of all the animals they’ve got the smallest brain and it’s a long way back in the head, and, you actually need quite a lot of power to get through to it, and you can’t, there’s, they can’t, they can’t be bolted successfully that’s why in the slaughterhouse situation you use stunners, electric stunners, because they can’t be bolted, well on site there, it’s difficult ye see they haven’t got the stunners so they had to either try to bolt them or where there are large sows and boars, I mean you shot them with a rifle, and erm, I had eleven to do, so they turned (inaudible ) pen the size of (inaudible) and I shot this one with a little thirty eight, thirty eight special, was one, was one of the small rifles I use, (inaudible ) take a, a one tonne bullock over twenty five metres (inaudible ) and I shot this, sow, with this thirty eight only from a metre away, but the heads are going all the time, bang and it just squealed and walked off, ha, ha, within ten seconds you wouldn’t have thought ha ha it had a thirty eight bullet in it’s head, and, oh, and within two seconds the rifles reloaded an, yeah, I mean, yeah, I can laugh about it now, I mean like at the time I was oh no, I don’t believe it, and in actual fact erm, I finished off the eleven, I didn’t have the problem again with another one, but from that day forward I never used that rifle again on pigs, because it hadn’t quite got the power, I didn’t feel, and prior to using that particular rifle I’d always used the middle of my three rifles as one might say and I went back to using the middle rifle for pigs, again, ‘cos it’s very different, you’ve got (inaudible) the sort of speed it was doing, I mean the little one was doing eight hundred feet per second (inaudible) the next one up was doing, er, the one that I normally use for pigs, was doing two thousand feet per second, three thousand feet per second which is nearly two thousand mile an hour, which is nearly two thousand mile an hour

Crikey

Yeah, and so, ye know, who can tell you this,

Yeas

Ye know, there’s, there’s not a soul in the country that I could go to and ask how do you do this, how do you do that, there’s nothing, no school report on it, there’s nothing, the best you get is BASS which is a shooter’s association, he’s a, he’s classed as a (inaudible) putting all this legislation, on jules, how many jules you need to take out whatever hundred and eight animals, it’s just a load of rubbish, ‘cos at the end of the day they haven’t a clue, they’re just statistics on paper, ye know what, I can tell you exactly what you need, what will do what, and what won’t do what, and ye know sort of thing, I mean it’s quite fascinating, the police have actually got a copy of the video, of the training video.

Well, of course they’ve been called in sometimes,

Exactly, exactly

Something escapes onto the road

Exactly, and then they had a few situations like where, erm, actually the inspector said to me, I think if other (inaudible) ‘cos it took I don’t know how many bullets to kill it, ye know, and I said to him yeah, I said, when you’re putting the bullet in the right place, obviously, because he was using, a weapon, which was bigger than my biggest weapon, and I could put an animal away with my smallest weapon, with one bullet, but again it’s placing the bullet ....on this video, I mean (inaudible) guidelines (inaudible) and on this video it shows you ....erm.... it shows you, ye know, (inaudible ) it shows you three shots, and it wasn’t done, ye know, it was, this video was erm, it wasn’t set up, put up.

No, it was just done on the day

Just another job, nine o’clock in the morning, and about twenty past nine I was ready to start, and erm, the vet said to me, erm well we’ll have to hang on for a bit H, erm, the er, erm, there’s a video crew coming, if that’s alright, that’s how I got it, that’s alright I said, yeah no bother, I really hadn’t got any choice really ha, ha well I had I suppose, but er, yeah, and that’s how it, how it come about, just a one off job, ye know, it wasn’t a set up, put up, what you see is as it was, yeah, no set up..........mmm ...... I think mebbe I should write a book.......... I’ll tell you what there’s plenty who’re writing books and none of the buggers have been on the job,  (inaudible)

Is that right?

Yeah, there is, old watsername, Greg Dyke done one, chairman of the BBC, yeah he’s done one, have a look, when he’s been up here, you’ve got the Brigadier doing a bit and someone else doing a bit, an, an er.......(inaudible)

Can I switch that off, is there anything else?

Well, er I dunno, I’m not sure, whatever you want to do, anything else you want to know, it’s what you want to know really.................

I drove into the car-park of the modern veterinary practice.  The receptionist warned me that M had been called out on an emergency so I waited 40 minutes or so. M greeted me warmly and took me to a meeting-sized room upstairs that was dominated by a large table with chairs and shelves of text-books and manuals.  We moved into an adjacent small kitchen to make tea and then settled down with the tape switched on. 

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and your background?

Born in Sheffield, brought up south of England, studied at Edinburgh University, got married, worked in N as a mixed practice for two years, and I’ve been working here in Cumbria since [then].  I’m married with four children.

And why Cumbria?

I wanted to do dairy practice.  I spent quite a long time in the last six months when I was at N working for a dairy practice where I could become a partner.

And what about your wife?

My wife is a teacher, she has just started back doing supply.

And where was she originally from?

She is [non-UK] by birth but she was brought up in [UK].

So neither of you are local but you’ve been here some years?

Fourteen years.

And I know you’ve got a son who is seven, do you have any other children?

There [are two more boys] and a girl.

So thinking about foot and mouth, obviously you’re not old enough to have any first hand experience of the 67– 68 outbreak, or do you?

I have a very vague recollection of walking to school and seeing notices up, but it’s very vague.

Where was this?

Epsom Downs.  There was one farm that still had animals when I was very young.

Since this recent outbreak, did you hear any tales about the 67 out-break?

Not directly.  I have a friend,  who was out in Thailand and I was out there visiting him and he was talking about foot and mouth, because it’s one of the problems that they have there and they were vaccinating cattle there, at the market.  So I was talking to him a bit, but it wasn’t just about the 67 out-break, more about the Thailand experience.

So what about the most recent outbreak, what’s your first memory?

My first memory is actually going back two years, not one year, two years, to February 2000, because there was a meeting organised by Maff State Veterinary Service [SVS], for TVIs [Temporary Veterinary Inspectors] , at which they were talking about issues facing agriculture.  TB was one of the ones, and the threat of other zoonotic diseases of which the most prevalent was foot and mouth disease.  So that was almost a year to the day before it all blew up again.

Was that part of a series of talks?

We had another one a year later, just, the speaker who was at the second one was the Welsh D.V.M. [Director of Veterinary Medicine] whose name alludes me.  But he’s the chief  epidemiologist,   he was speaking about the out-break of swine [inaudible] disease, no swine fever disease, they’d had just in the previous few months to that, November, December, January, and he was speaking about the epidemiology of that, and he had to leave the meeting to go down to London because it was confirmed later on that week.

So did you come away from that first meeting with any sense of alarm?

Not alarm, it’s just , yes, you know, zoonotic diseases were around and foot and mouth was probably one of the most worried about but they were obviously very worried about TB spreading from the South West into Cumbria, but obviously it was on the agenda to be looking out for it.

So did you come back to this practice with a very clear remit about foot and mouth and what to look out for?

No.  There was no guidelines.  The emphasis was on clinical signs and things like that.  There was a speaker from P, again If I had my notes I could remember his name.  He was speaking about how it quickly became politicised and other things.  So it was quite interesting, and if you look back on it you think,  yes it was very relevant but they were far more concerned with getting across information on epidemiology, information on the clinical presentation rather than on control.  Very little thought actually seemed to have gone on, looking back with hindsight, on the control mechanisms and how if there was [EMPHASIS]  going to be an out-break, how it would be coped with.  Looking back I think I was very naïve, everybody was very naïve, thinking yes if foot and mouth comes it will get slaughtered, and that was that.   And also the emphasis was [EMPHASIS] very much on that it would be in pigs and cattle, that’s were it would be.  Because all the text books say sheep are very poor infectors of foot and mouth disease, you know they’ll not produce much virus unless you stress them through an auction in Longtown, whereas pigs produce a large amount of virus very quickly.  But again it’s one of the things that I think I get very frustrated with the Ministry’s mindset, is that they have no flexibility, there is no sort of ‘what ifs’, it is, you go across from A to B to C to D and somebody has sat down and thought about a logical pattern, which is fine, but biological systems don’t work like that.

Are you saying almost that it became a political issue and really it should have been very much a veterinary issue?

No.  What I’m saying is that it became very political very quickly and the Ministry just couldn’t cope. 

In those early days what was -and maybe still is- your view point on vaccination?

Vaccination I’m ambivalent about.  I think the roll over vaccination is to ‘ring  fence’ around an area that’s infected.  By the time of diagnosis of the pigs from the abattoir, the virus had already reached forty-nine separate farms up and down the country, so therefore to use vaccination in its classical role as a ‘ring a fence’ around that, you’re too late.  You know, you’re trying to ring fence around forty-nine different areas.  Yes, there was maybe an argument that they should have vaccinated all the sheep in Cumbria rather than slaughtering them, but they didn’t have vaccine available and the Ministry did not have the logistics to do it and they weren’t prepared to delegate it down.

The suggestion is that it got out of control almost immediately. I mean by the first diagnosis, because of movement of live stock, it had already spread beyond a ring infected area?  

Yes.

So what’s your view then on how it was handled in that early phase?
  
The early phase, in the initial few weeks London was saying, it’s under control, and telling Carlisle, it’s under control isn’t it Carlisle, and Carlisle was going, yes.  Civil servants in Carlisle are chosen for being a second pair of hands  that does everything according to the book and agrees with London about everything. . . . . .

[Telephone rings, tape stopped, interviewee then recaps and interview resumed]
. . . . .
 and doesn’t make waves, so they agreed with London.  There were cases where well it was obviously out of control, they had dead bodies everywhere and London did not know about it.  When J S came up you could see the colour drain from his face, as we were all stood there and told him, you know, it is [EMPHASIS] out of control, there are [EMPHASIS] dead bodies lying everywhere.

And this was March?

This was March the 23rd I think it was.

So what was happening in terms of your everyday practice?

I went on March the 2nd to work for Defra.

So did you volunteer?

We rang Carlisle to say, did they want a vet and they said yes, so we sent one of our assistants.  He worked here, so he volunteered, so he would go.  He rang up and said, it’s desperate here, so by then we weren’t doing routine visits and things, we were cutting the work load right down, and I said, look I’ll go as well, we’ll try and see if we can keep it the other side of Carlisle.  The idea was to try and stop foot and mouth getting to Wigton.

So basically you were seconded to Defra, so can you tell me a little bit about your role there?

Everybody asks what training do you have when you go to work for the Ministry, which consisted of somebody saying, “Mike, you know what you’re doing, there’s the forms, get out there and do it.  Make sure that you keep a carbon copy of everything that you do.”  They said form As do this form Bs do this, and that was it. 

 Were you familiar with the forms? 

 They were absolutely horrendous [EMPHASIS].

How did you deal with that?

Basically, speaking to the other vets who were there at the time, you know, and saying, you know, what do you do, and this and that and whatever [PAUSE]  and again [EMPHASIS]  communications were a real problem.  They had one phone line for vets phone back in on.  I argued with them, and said, look I’ll [EMPHASIS] get the GPO and I’ll get them in here, and they said, “oh you can’t do that you’ve got to go through the proper channels”, I said, “stuff the proper channels we’ll just get them in and sort that out afterwards.”

So a very frustrating time?

Very frustrating.  I think my worst moment was when we had a meeting of all the team, there was a briefing meetings, and there was a briefing meeting of TVIs and at the end of the day if you were there you went.  After Nick Brown stood up and he said he was going to slaughter everything in Cumbria, that was in 3 kilometres. He meant it. He meant it.  Cattle, sheep, pigs, everything in 3 kilometres [PAUSE]  and there were dead bodies everywhere. There were twelve report cases that farmers had phoned in saying, we think we’ve got foot and mouth, we’d like a vet to see it, and there weren’t any vets to go and see them [PAUSE]  and then Nick Brown stands up and says he’s going to slaughter all the rest of these animals, and I argued quite passionately I think is the word, in that meeting, with the DVM that he couldn’t get the report cases in, he couldn’t get the animals that were ill, slaughtered, he couldn’t get rid of the disposed, so how [EMPHASIS]  was he going to get these ones done, you know [PAUSE]  and his [EMPHASIS] response was, the Minister has said it so we will carry it out, and I very nearly thumped him [PAUSE].  I was completely wound up.


And then of course. . . .  

 Well it wasn’t going  to happen, apparently the other thing is, that night, the local vets also rang round, and there was a… we put our view forward that it was not going to go [PAUSE]  and that’s when J S was due to come up to discuss the situations.

  And that’s when he realised the scale? 

 That’s when he realised the scale.

So what do you think should have happened?

The problem is, is that the Ministry of Agriculture is very… The State Veterinary Service is very [EMPHASIS] very centralised, and power is in London, and they wouldn’t let it go [PAUSE].  They [EMPHASIS] had the computer systems in place from the previous out-break of swine fever,  the previous autumn, so they were almost up and running for [EMPHASIS]   that, and they thought, “oh we can run it from London.”  The problem with that sort of situation, power has to be taken [EMPHASIS]   back down, you know.  If it’s never given back down [EMPHASIS]  it has to be taken, and people who have been put in charge in Carlisle have been put there because they’re a safe pair of hands and they’re not going to do that, they are not going to rock the boat.  So what should have happened is [EMPHASIS] as soon as they realised… 

[DISTURBED BY SON ENTERING THE ROOM].

Where were we?

 Talking about local control.  

Yes, it should have come back to local control, but they wouldn’t delegate that [PAUSE]   and even further, I think they were trying to run the whole of Cumbria, Newcastle, Bishop Auckland, Durham from Carlisle, and again, that should have been dissolved down earlier on.  The decision should have been made from a local area.  Later on I was involved… I was on report cases until it moved through Wigton and once things got up and running and there were enough vets and whatever, I went on  to surveillance and was in charge of Longtown surveillance, and tried to organise that [PAUSE]    and then went to the protection zone lifting, you know, all form Ds, the rings, trying to get those removed as quickly as possible and get Cumbria farming.

If you go back to the early days, how were you received on farms?

Most of the early ones were either report cases where somebody phoned up or they were sort of tracings where, you know, they had animals that at Longtown or something like that.  And yes they were nervous, they were whatever.  I have an ability to talk as this tape is probably showing, and I can communicate with Cumbrian farmers and I usually win people’s confidence quite easily, and I also have a bit more age about me than some of the younger TVIs, and experience.  You know, if you’re a large animal vet, you know, you know what you’re talking about.

What was your personal feelings’, say if you were going onto a farm where foot and mouth is confirmed and you know that the next stage is going to be a cull, what was that like for you personally?

There’s always the feeling of dread as you go to look at the animal, and there’s also that horrible [EMPHASIS] thing of, that you cannot diagnose foot and mouth, that’s Page Street in London’s job.  So you have to ring up Page Street like some six year old little boy and say what you’ve found, fill in their horrendous forms and then discuss it with somebody in London who may of never seen foot and mouth, may not even be a large animal practitioner, is probably not [EMPHASIS] a large animal clinician, and you’re trying to say, actually yes it is, or no it isn’t.  In the early days I didn’t have much problem with Page Street but in the late days I had real arguments with Page Street and went ballistic with them on occasions. 

Do you mean in terms of diagnosis or in terms of paperwork? 

What really, really annoyed me was, I was a second opinion on a case, I wanted to take samples because it was non typical, there was an oddball virus going through, that I heard it was not [EMPHASIS] typical of foot and mouth disease, there was a lot of talk that the sheep were showing odd signs, there were cattle showing odd signs, was what I wanted to know, I wanted to take samples, I wanted to know the results of those samples, and they wouldn’t do it [PAUSE] you know, and I had to decide there and then, are you slaughtering this herd out because it’s got an oddball virus going through it, everybody else has got foot and mouth, black as it is, this is foot and mouth, or do I walk away and come back again, you know, when there are more cows ill, showing more odd signs.  I still think, I am still of the opinion that the Ministry, the Chief Veterinary Officer is going against the professional ethics of The Royal College, in saying that we are not allowed to set up or be aware of a second opinion levels to take samples, and I think the Royal College representatives have been very remiss in terms of its treatment of the CVO [Chief Veterinary Officer] and the whole government, you know.

So were there times when you felt de-professionalised?

Not totally.  I’m a cog in a machine.  The thing is, diagnosis for that   disease, in its classical form, is not [EMPHASIS]   difficult.

It is quite straightforward is it? 

Yes.  If they’ve got classical foot and mouth disease, you know, the farmers knew [EMPHASIS and PAUSE].  Ok, if they’ve had low doses of virus and it’s mild, or it’s not classical presentation, or it’s a single animal, yes maybe there’s an argument there.

Or there’s a lot of anxiety and the cattle got lacerations in their mouths and they just needed you to come out because there is a big fear?

Yes.  There’s plenty of case when I went to see, and yes, they were chewing something, don’t worry about it.

So what were you doing with all this frustration and anger?

It’s still there to a certain extent.

I mean how was it affecting you in terms of your health and things like sleeping and eating patterns?

Well in the early days, remember I was working long hours.  I mean there were some days when I didn’t finish till two in the morning and I was back down at seven.

So what was this doing to you?

The thing is you can do it for a month on the adrenalin, you know, you can live on the adrenalin.

Well you can but it’s not good is it?

Yes, but [LONG PAUSE] at the time it was, you know, you just do it [PAUSE].  But I found the frustration of dealing with the Ministry the hardest thing [PAUSE],  and the farmers are the same, you know, just stupid bureaucracy.  They’re running it by computer and if you happen to get the boxes ticked wrongly, or you know, whatever.

But in terms of your long days and dealing with a lot of frustration and anger, what was happening with your family?

I didn’t see a lot of the kids [PAUSE] but [EMPHASIS AND PAUSE]   you know [PAUSE]   I think they found it hard as well.

Did they understand?

Well they knew what was going on, there was pyres all round us, we live out in the country.  There was a pile of dead sheep outside our backdoor for two weeks.

And you had farming neighbours so how was that for you, as a neighbour, I mean were they aware that you were working for Defra?

Well while I was working for Defra and I had animals, they didn’t come any where [EMPHASIS] near me, which, yes, I understand.

How was that for you, I mean are you normally quite neighbourly?

Um [PAUSE]  yes, we’d stop and chat and whatever, but, you know, nobody [EMPHASIS]  was coming out of their farms.  Nobody [EMPHASIS] was stopping and chatting, you know, there was no [EMPHASIS] traffic on the roads, you know, the farmers where hunkered down, so life stopped.

So there probably wasn’t time for a social life and even if there was, was there one to be had?

Well yes, I’ve got a lot of friends in Carlisle and Wigton who are non farming circle and we’ve carried on. 

 But there wasn’t time in the initial stages.  

And obviously you’re just tired.

Did you actually feel quite up tight?

You go through phases. When you’re trying to sort of change something in the Ministry’s policy or something like that [PAUSE]  or, you know, [PAUSE],  like in the early days one of the things I would always do was go and speak to the epidemiologists and tell them what was going on, because they would receive the information. Because if you were a vet you would go out and slaughter something, go and sort it all out, come back, write your reports, put your reports in, so the epidemiologists would find out five or six days after it happened [PAUSE], well it’s old news.  That got sorted out.  I would go in, because I would be in touch with G, one of the vets here, you know, and I told them, you know, we’re losing it, it’s gone down the whole of the Solway coast, you know, it’s gone in the wind, you get single animals, there’s farms in that place there, you know, they’ve gone down, you know, you’ve completely lost it.  I remember speaking to them and they said, well we haven’t heard of any of these cases, I said well you wouldn’t have yet, they’re still being slaughtered, and whatever, as we talk.

So even local communication wasn’t good?

Oh there was a real [EMPHASIS] block between what was going on, on the ground at Carlisle, then there was another block between Carlisle and Page Street, and there was another block between Page Street and the Cabinet Office [LONG PAUSE].  You know, Tony Blair asked the Cabinet, is it going well lads?  Yes it’s all under control, you know.  I don’t think Tony Blair realised what was going on until he came up [LONG PAUSE].  It was interesting talking to John Snow at that time, because…  

When he came up? 

 When he came up, because he was saying nobody in London knows what’s going on.  He said it’s a long way for journalists to come up here, and it’s a long way for politicians to come up here.  I mean, even now the TV programmes and things tends to feature Devon, Wales, you know, whereas, you know, it’s not often that Cumbria comes up and yet half the cases were in Cumbria.

There are lots of lay theories about the spread of foot and mouth in Cumbria, do you have your own personal view?

My view, which is probably controversial, the virus is stable in any temperature as long as it’s stable, it doesn’t like variations in temperature, Fs in S stood for ten or twelve days from getting the virus, two hundred cattle producing huge [EMPHASIS]  amounts of virus and there was a North East wind from Longtown with snow and cold, it was frosty, so I don’t know whether you’ve ever been in a cattle shed but cattle breathe out and immediately form droplets, which go up out through the roof and freeze, so basically you then get packets of frozen virus, which is quite stable because once its frozen the temperature is stable at minus one to nought degrees, that wind that came down the Solway coast.  

I was going to say, you can track it can’t you?  

You can track it down from that North East wind, and it came [EMPHASIS] in packets.  So a lot of the early seeding cases were either in sheep outside, or in individual animals that were facing that direction.  Now I know they’ve done a lot of work to try and figure out how it spread and whatever, but that is that is my view of how it spread down the Solway, and the thing is once it’s seeded out, you know, once one person got it, it just knocked on and knocked on.  So there was a lot of different ways of how it spread but the initial spread was from the pigs to the sheep, from the sheep to the different markets.  Longtown Mart has a big layerage, it got through into the layerage, it was in the layerage, the sheep were stressed, they produced lots of virus.  Market work then took it to the various farms around Longtown, the sheep took it to various places, Devon, Cornwall and onwards. Maybe that snow was important, maybe it’s not, but, you know, then local spread.  A lot [EMPHASIS] of the early pyres were made by TVIs who had never made anything like this before, there was very little in the way of guidelines or anything.

You’re saying that you could cut down the smoke levels or the way they burn or..?

I think the early pyres were poorly made.  A lot of the animals were not stuck [ stabbed] to release the gas, so therefore what you’re wanting is an initial sharp burn so the virus is killed, but some of them didn’t burn too well.  The other thing is, because the cattle weren’t stuck to release the gases they were put on and heated up and they just burst and the contents went up in the air.  So there may be an issue there, I don’t know. 


You know, the thing is, because the fires didn’t burn down properly, you know, the foxes and whatever got out and pulled them around.

And what about the burial of carcasses, what do you think of that?

My view is that every farm should have burial sites organised for enough animals on that farm so that if there is ever an outbreak … because there is a lot of concentration of foot and mouth disease but there are other things that could  be a problem.

Do you see any problems with soil or water contamination?

There are issues to do with that, but if you had planned burial site that was approved by the Environment Agency and they said what you were suppose to do to ensure that it didn’t get into them.

Presumably you’re talking about fairly manageable in terms of size?

That’s it, you know.  If you bury twenty in this field, twenty in the next field, twenty in the next field, it’s not a problem.  It’s when you bury four million or is it two million at Great Orton you start to have…

I was going to say, do you have particular worries about ground water?  I’m thinking about Great Orton, there are a lot of underground rivers and water causeways aren’t there?

Yes but, it’s being managed by… have you met the guy that’s doing the management  ?  

Yes. 

 It’s quite impressive, and the other thing is, what they’re doing is that they’re draining water into the site, so therefore all the water drains into the site and it’s then treated so the water from surroundings drains into it, so therefore nothing’s going to drain out of it because they’re already draining water into it.  

So is this water removed?   

No it’s treated.  

So it’s recycled?

Well I don’t know what they’re doing with it at the moment but they were hoping to build a treatment plant on site, but they were tankering it down to Workington for treatment, there’s a treatment site there.

Where it would then be recycled?

Well, I think it then goes out to the North Sea.

What about the whole cleaning up process, I’m particularly thinking about disinfectant.  I know some farmers talked about vercon for example. 

The thing about vercon and a lot of the disinfectants, they’re actually quite safe in that, you use too much and the first thing you get is an acid burn.  You do feel it so therefore it’s not something that’s insidious, if you have too much you know about it.

Do you think it was effective?

I have strong views about cleaning up.  I have strong views on the cleaning up. If you look on the OIE website, which is like the World Health Organisation for vets, foot and mouth virus can persist in bedding and hide in other places, in infected doses it doses for up to…

 Right.

  That’s if you do nothing.  This is a fragile virus, change the temperature change the PH, it’s dead.  If you have it from infected animals, faeces will protect, you know, organic matter will protect it from disinfectants, but [EMPHASIS] no muck, no virus.  

Ok.  So you’ve got to clean it up, from the cracks and crevasses. 

 Or [EMPHASIS]   you leave it for a month.  Most of the farms around here… it’s twelve months ago and they’re still having problems getting the Ministry to sign them off.  You know, the level of cleaning is totally ridiculous.  You need something like five grams of fresh [EMPHASIS]  material, is enough to protect a virus from an outside spray, so if you put an aerosol spray over it, it will protect it.

[TAPE TURN OVER]

So we were talking about a disinfectant.  My feeling there is that you’re saying, if you leave it alone for a month… 

 It will be fine [PAUSE].   Right, if you pressure-wash out once, as most of the farmers would have done if you’d just left them alone they would have done, but they’ve spent what, a million pounds trying to clean up some of these farms.  A complete waste of time and a waste of money.  

We need to think about closing down soon so I would like to ask how you feel now, in terms of you personally…?

I’m still not back on an even keel, and I don’t think many people are.  You know, both the farmers that stayed in, didn’t get foot and mouth, and were on tenter hooks waiting, and then had the frustration of dealing with the Ministry, and those who went out with foot and mouth and had all the hassle of dealing with the Ministry [PAUSE].  I think the disease is bad but I think dealing with the Ministry is almost as bad [PAUSE],  and the thing that the governments have forgotten is that disease control is done by the state on behalf of farmers or again, in human populations, disease control is done by the state on behalf of the population, and the whole view point of that has been lost in that it’s a self perpetuating  bureaucracy  where the service say, we’re [EMPHASIS] Maff,  we’re [EMPHASIS] Defra, you know, we’re [EMPHASIS]  doing this, you know, you are [EMPHASIS]  going to agree to this, and the whole dictatorial  emphasis from Page Street, you know [PAUSE]  it’s just wrong [EMPHASIS AND PAUSE], and you know, there’s a lot of South African vets who come across, who have just been amazed by the attitude of the whole of Defra.  They have forgotten that they we’re doing it on behalf of the farmers. 

 

The other thing is, I think the Ministry to a certain extent is like any bully, if you stand up to them and tell them, no, they tent to back off, but the problem is, is that they just keep on like a grinding machine.  I don’t know what the answer is.

Well I was going to say, in professional terms, what is the future for you within this profession?

A lot depends on the future of agriculture [PAUSE]  for us, in this dairying area, it is two things.  How much work is the Ministry going to put our way and what is going to be the price of milk in order to pay the farmers to pay us?   We are still two vets down because people haven’t restocked and we’re not confident enough to take on more staff yet [PAUSE], maybe in eighteen months time.

So the future is still quite fragile?

Oh yes.

And that causes concern?

[LONG PAUSE] I don’t know about concern [PAUSE]   opportunities [LAUGHTER]. 

 Being positive.  

Being positive.

There is a lot I haven’t asked you, but is there any thing in particular that you would really like to comment on?

It’s funny actually, what you said about the kids, my middle son Tim has always been very keen on animals and vetting, you know, he used to come out with me on call and obviously when foot and mouth started he couldn’t come, and then when everything started getting shot round and about, it did affect him and even now he doesn’t want to be a vet anymore.  

How old is he? 

 He’s only young, he’s nine.  It’s sort of disillusioned him for what being a vet is. 

 Like a kick in the teeth?  

I think it is.  Part of me thinks would I work for the Ministry again next time or would I stay on the outside?  

Can you stay on the outside?  

Oh I was a volunteer [PAUSE]  with 24 hours notice, as I pointed out on quite a few occasions [PAUSE]. But, you know, I think somebody had to. They needed vets in the early days and while I was doing good in there, I felt I should stay.

It must have left you with a great raft of feelings.  Perhaps you’re almost too close to it yet?

Probably [PAUSE].  You know, I think it’s affected a lot of people in lots of different ways and I think the other thing is, is that talking to some of the farmers, it’s crystallised a lot of their thinking and what they’re going to do in the future, whereas maybe they would have just carried on, now they are looking at other things. 

 Particularly in Cumbria I suppose. 

 [PAUSE]  well no I think generally, because there’s a lot of Cumbrian farmers who have gone and bought whole herds, well they have bought a whole herd  off somebody else who is going to do something else.
