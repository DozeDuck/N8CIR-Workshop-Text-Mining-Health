ery interesting day when we had a farm walk with about 15 farmers and 3 of them were from NZ.  The 3 came over to see how dairy farming is done over here.  They were very interested in F&M as they remembered seeing a lot of it on TV over there.  After tou
ring 3 or 4 farms in the area, they came to the conclusion that the county had recovered very fast after F&M.  We leaned quite a lot about dairy farming over there.

This week I had my first day working with sheep for a long while. We have sheep taken in for the winter off my father-in-law and h
e decided that they needed dipping. This time he was going to have a go with a sheep shower to see if it was any easier. Well it was, a lot easier. It should have been invented years ago when we had sheep. I don\rquote 
t miss having our own sheep and they don\rquote t bring any bad memories of the day they were taken. In some ways we didn\rquote t mind ours going if was to save the cows.
\par 
\par The contractors came on Wednesday to clip all the cows. They look a lot better all clipped out. The contractor that comes was working on the 
first farm that got FMD in Cumbria. I always think of him as the first FMD victim and not a clipping contractor. On Saturday I went to visit the farm mentioned in an earlier diary. This was the place that had all the new equipment and buildings but had lo
st a lot of good cows. Some of the new equipment had even been changed at a year old for new again! Also a conservatory had been put on the house. I still feel exactly the same as I did last time.

been concentrated on first. The Ministry vets must think we are the lower risk herds or is that just a high opinion of ourselves? This week we had visits from the accountants and Bank Manager as it was near our year end. If you want to look at it cynicall

This week was mostly taken up finishing jobs off for Xmas so there was as little to be done as possible over the holiday period. It mus
t be a year ago this week since we started to fill in the diaries. It has passed very quickly looking back. This year it doesn\rquote 
t seem to have been such a chore to work over Xmas as it has done in the past. Probably the new milking parlour and the building 
improvements we did in the Autumn has helped. It goes to show a good setup and equipment makes working much more pleasant. No mention at all about FMD all Xmas, apart from on Xmas eve a farmer, BA called in to drop off a couple of toys that ha
d been donated to the trust that he works for. It wasn\rquote 
t that much, but I was very touched by the thought. He stopped for quite a while and had a long chat with father over a cup of tea. He seems to be doing a lot of that now he has partially left farming 
and working for the trust. Our neighbour who has a few problems at the moment has been very pleased to see him last week. On the Sunday night we went to see \lquote jack and the beanstalk\rquote 
 at Carlisle, it was quite good and the kids enjoyed it very much. I was thinking wouldn\rquote t it have been nice for them to have a real cow on stage to play Daisy to show them that not all the cows in Cumbria were shot.
