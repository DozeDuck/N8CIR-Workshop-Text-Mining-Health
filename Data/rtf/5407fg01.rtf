is nothing better for yows and lambs than that.   Anyway we messed about and I brought the fodder beet all back on Good Friday I think and then on Easter Saturday a neighbouring farm they went down and then over the weekend the found another 3 farms all r

d a herd of pedigree (cows) limousin cattle which was all bred on the farm and I didn\rquote 
t want to see them go but they were found in a field of sheep so they had to go.  That was all right, that is all gone but there was only us and another farm in our villag
