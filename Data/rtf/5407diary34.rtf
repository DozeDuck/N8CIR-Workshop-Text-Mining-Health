\par Not a lot been talked about FM as people have had enough of it now - they seem to want to get on with th
eir lives and try and put it behind them.  There are still reminders everywhere, on the TV and in the papers. We are just relieved that we don't have to disinfect everything between every farm and every time we wash things, it is a little worrying as all 
the disinfectant seems to be bringing the paint off the wheels on the tractors and the machines.  That at least is going to be a lasting reminder of what we were doing in 2001.

\par I went to the sale on Saturday.  Big crowds at the sale.  Lots of farmers and contractors talking about the prices and how much money Snowie will have made and if they were under investigation by the 'government'.
\par It was quite eerie and upsetting looking around the trucks and the loadals. And thinking about the jobs these machines had been doing this time last year.  Everyone still talking about the lack of organisation and how the disease g

 last one we were at which had had FMD, but is now fully re-stocked and is now expanding, by taking land off a neighbouring farm who isn't going to restock.  And by keeping more dairy cows.  I'm not sure if this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing 
f
or us.  As this seems to be  a trend, some people deciding not to restock and others now having the finances to expand.  It is going to cut the number of customers down.  But it may make the work load more centralised.  On Saturday night I went to the pub
 with some friends as one of them had just had a baby boy this week, so a good chance to unwind and have a celebration.

\par Went to cut a hedge for a lady at Grassland Nurseries.  She was telling me how she missed seein
g all the lambs in the fields around her home as the farms around her haven't re-stocked with sheep yet.  She said the fields there are still quiet when they would normally be full of lambs.  I hadn't thought much about that until now.  I supposed I had b
een used to seeing empty fields.  On Tuesday I visited Jerriestown farm as they were having a farm sale, Mrs }{\fs24\insrsid2826641 B}{\fs24\insrsid16592859 
 had FMD and he decided not to re-stock but just to let her land off to other farmers.  I wanted to buy something as she has been a good customer but everything was too dear.  Another farm been split up and added to bigger ones!
\par 
\par Later this week I went to WH}{\fs24\insrsid14107706 \rquote s}{\fs24\insrsid16592859  farm at Flat Bank, Gaitsgill to do some fencing.  He still only has a few cattle on his farm.  He was complaining that he can't get back into 
milk production because he can't get the men to come to put his milking Parlour back together after it has been washed and disinfected as they are so busy.  He said he wants to get back into the routine again.  It seemed strange being back at Flat Bank as
 usually there were lots of cattle there and they were usually working late at night to get everything done. But not this time.  Not yet anyway.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid16592859 Busy week this week as ploughing has now started.  Went to plough a field for }{\fs24\insrsid14107706 JF}{\fs24\insrsid16592859  at Burnfoot, Longtow
n. This was something new as they never normally do any ploughing.  He told me that the field I was ploughing had not been since his Uncle ploughed it during the War.  He said the only reason he was ploughing it now was because they had buried all his cat
t
le and sheep in the middle of it.  So he needed to get rid of the sight and the damage caused in the building of the fire.  The field was quite a mess as it was one of the earlier cases around Longtown so the land was still quite wet at that time.  It all
 
went well until I started to plough the actual site of the fire. It was quite difficult to plough there as the soil had been dug up and this had made it wet and loose, so had to go slower.  Which gave me a little more time to think about and remember what
 happened there last year.  It brings back the memories of the smells of the fires and the picture of the fires on the TV and in the papers. Talking to Mr Tinning afterward, he said as do most farmers!, we don't ever want to see that again

Estate, for 2 brothers who have been helped in one way by FM.  Initially they were affected by the same things as everyone else, e.g. they lost their sheep in the live cull and for a week or two their
 dairy herd was under threat due to the contiguous cull policy in Scotland, as a neighbouring farm had FMD.  But now that farmer is retiring and the hall brothers have got the tenancy of his farm which will allow them to split their business up and farm o
n
 their own, which they have been trying for a number of years.  The compensation from the sheep is also going to help them stock the new farm as they are not going to keep sheep on the home farm for a little while.  So in a strange way FM has helped them 
in the end, although it didn't seem that way at first.  So they are looking forward and planning for the future, which I feel helps us all to feel a little more optimistic about the future of farming etc.

r the extra time they had to keep them on the farm.
\par \tab This makes me feel sorry for them just as much and more in some cases as we did for the people that had to experience the slaughter of their animals. Because although it must have been a terrible time for
 them, at least once the carcasses had been disposed of and the paper sorted out, the main of it was over for them. Where as for everyone else it carried on all year, with all there paperwork and trying to sell animals for about 1/5 of some of the slaught

 owns it isn't a farmer so hasn't really been affected by F.M.D other than seeing what was going on, on the farms around him at the time. He is a Partner in an engineering company. He bought the farm about 5 years ago. And we have now just about re-fenced
 
it all for him. He just lets most of his land out to neighbouring farmers, apart from a couple of fields he keeps for their horses. He said he managed to let his land last year still, but at a reduced price, and the same again this year. I suppose he has 
b
een affected in that way. But it is not a major problem as he just lets the land as an easy way of keeping it tidy. He said that their business hasn't been really been affected, as one of the main things that they do is make parts for J.C.B diggers. He sa

said last week most of the farms we are ploughing on are doing it partly to try and cut their feed costs, and partly because a lot of them haven't fully restocked with sheep etc. They all seem to be saying the same thing. That during the foot and mouth ou
t
break the fat cattle price and the fat lamb price and the milk price to them came down a lot and is still coming down. Even though it still seems to be going up in the shops and supermarkets. The supermarkets say it is due to rising costs but farmers cost
 
and other costs are still going up at the same rate as theirs but our incomes are coming down. This is affecting us as the farmers want the work done cheaper. So we have to do more and more to stand still. Which means we spend more time at work than at ho
me. This process of the prices coming down was happening before F.M.D but it has increased ten fold.

Not as busy this week as we have most of the spring work done. But the weather has turned wet and cold again, so we can't get on with very much. We did a little ploughing and muck spreading but we were mainly working in the yard making the si

 price they were getting twenty years ago. As I said the other day this has come down a lot since F.M.D and he says that there milk buyer says it won't get any better this year. They don't think as the supermarkets are importing cheap milk from the EU. Bu

 some hedge trimming. This was one of the first farms to get F.M.D, it still doesn't feel right when you go to a farm and there are still no animals on it as they are still not restocking until next month. Because of milk prices and cow prices being so hi

 were finishing off the few hedge cutting jobs. I spent a lot of my time running about for parts again!  - as one of the tractors broke down and cleaning up in the yard after the last frost.
\par One of the farms they 
were hedging has seen some big changes since they had Foot and Mouth. As before F&M they kept about 100 suckler cows and beef cattle and sheep.  But now have put in a new diary unit up and are keeping around 170 dairy cows.  And now they are just running 
it on their own, where as before they had one full time man.
\par On Wednesday I went to our local milk study group, Farm Walk of which I am a member and have been ever since the early 90s when I used to do a lot of relief milking.  We visited 2 dairy farms, nei
ther of which had F&M and both being dairy only, were not too badly affected by F&M, even though they were both in restricted areas.
\par 
\par In all it was an interesting day out and a chance to relax and see some people I hadn\rquote t seen for a while.  Talked to a man
 who had a beef farm and also had a large sheep dipping business.  But now he has gone back into dairying o his farm.  As when F&M came, he lost his cattle and his sheep dipping business collapsed over night.  He said they had virtually no income of about
 
8-10 weeks between the collapse of the dipping job and them actually getting F&M on their farm.  He said that in the end it has turned out ok as they are back in dairy farming now, but for quite a while they were very worried about what was going to happe
n.
\par On the whole F&M was not talked about other than a few jokes being made about the compensation money that the farmers received and how it had been spent. I suppose one good thing about the compensation that was paid to farmers is that they can\rquote 
t resist spending it one way or another, so at least it all ends up helping the economy.

 and I went to an Agricultural Machinery Show at Newark in Nottinghamshire. The show mainly consisted of large
 arable machinery which is not relevant to what we do, but it was a chance to have a day away with the lads and see something completely different in a different part of the country.

g prices for the new machines we need to buy for this year - mainly due to taking over a lime spreading contract off a local haulage firm.  So with this being a new venture we are going to need one or two new machines and an extra tractor.
\par The week has also given me a chance to think about the direction that the farmers around us are going in.  And how that will affect us and the business.
\par It seems that most of the dairy farms are concentrating more on just producing milk now. Wher
e as before F&M, they nearly all had a few sheep as well.  But hardly any of them have put sheep back on since they lost them in the cull.  But most of the sheep and beef farmers are keeping more sheep and beef cattle. It seems that most of them are going
 to concentrate on one or two enterprises and increasing the size of them rather than having a mixture of cattle, sheep and crops.
\par Most diary farms round here started to keep sheep again when milk quotas came in 1983. But as most of them lost their sheep ei
ther to F&M or in the live cull, the seem to have decided not to keep them again but to increase the cow numbers instead.  Hopefully this will help us as while they are concentrating on their increased cattle numbers, they will need to use us more to do t

Work is quieter at the moment partly because the weather has been a little better through the winter so farms can do more of their own work, and partly I think, that some of them are starting to tighten their belts ag
ain as the influx of cash from F&M is starting to run out. 
\par Also we have a lot more staff now so we are getting a lot more ground covered in less time.  Work mainly consists of slurry spreading and workshop maintenance and repairs.
\par On Saturday night of this week we held a party in our local village hall for family and friends.  As most of us have young children and we don\rquote 
t have the room at home to accommodate a lot of people, we decided to hold it in the hall and invite every one all together.  It seemed to go well.
\par We had a buffet supper, plenty of drink for the adults and toys and music for the kids.

This was the first big get together we have had since F&M, we have seen everyone since but had not had a good night out together.  Most people want to put the details of the disease and the day to day events during that time behind them now. 
\par  People still have their opinions about what effect it has had on the local and country\rquote s economy.  Most people are of the opinion that it gave a massive injection of muc
h needed cash at the time, but now most of it has gone, used up on surviving during the outbreak and restocking afterwards.  But nowhere is nothing to help farmers and all other related businesses to re-establish and restructure.  Now that the regulations
 and the market places have all changed and are still changing, it seems almost weekly!  It seems that it is getting harder for smaller businesses in the rural community to survive.  As it isn\rquote t easy for them to adapt to big changes overnight.

\par }{\f0\fs24\insrsid16592859 Work starting to pick up a little this week as with the dry weather some of the spring work is starting to come in, ploughing etc.
\par On Tuesday we went to my cousin\rquote s farm sale.  I worked for him for about 7 years before I started on my own.  He has deci
ded to give up farming and has bought a guest house in the Lake District.  He decided to give up the tenancy of his farm as the landlord wanted more rent but he wasn\rquote 
t prepared to do and of the repairs to the farm that were needed or to help with any inves
tment in new buildings etc.  Keith (my cousin) had been hit quite hard by F&M as he had sold all his breeding sheep in the Autumn before at rock bottom prices.  Then when all his neighbours got F&M he was unable to sell a lot of fat cattle because of rest
r
ictions etc. which then got too old to go into the food chain, so they were sold at a very low price as well.  So when his landlord decided he needed more rent, Keith said it was time to make a decision. As his son is at Leeds Uni and was unlikely to come
 home to  farm again, he decided to sell up and try something different.  Talking to people at the sale, I think a lot more people will be considering either retiring or trying something else if things don\rquote 
t change.  All farmers are already getting very sick of all the legislation and paperwork involved in keeping livestock and moving livestock since FMD

Not a very good start to the week as we all had to go to a family funeral on Monday.  An Uncle of mine died suddenly.  So it was a sad start to the week but it gave us a chance to catch up with some family members we haven\rquote

t so lucky.  For some of them it has helped them to spilt partnerships up.  But for others they lost 2 generations of breeding work with the pedigree herd.  As they said, unfortunately, no amount of money or any other help could replace that.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid16592859 Not very much to write about this week.  We have been quite busy at work again, spreading slurry again.  But very little else has happened or been said.
\par One farmer was complaining about some changes to the EU Subsidy system.  That meant if they made any major changes to their business in the year, they would lose all sub-payments in future years.  I didn\rquote t q
uite understand the ins and outs of it, but he was quite annoyed about it as he said we have had enough to put up with over the last couple of years.  We also did a job for Geoff Brown this week, he was one of the main contractors for the washing out afte
r FMD.  He told me that he made a lot of money on that job but he has had to reinvest it all to avoid paying a large amount of it back in tax.
\par And also to rebuild his business as all of his existing customers had gone elsewhere while he was on the FM job.  
He already had quite a large industrial cleaning business before. But now he has decided to diversify into work on the railways.  This is just another example of how the disease has hit many other businesses and industries, some not connected with agricul
ture at all.

dustry due to the aftermath of FMD.  Mainly changes to farming policy.  Some have changed from dairy to beef and vice versa.  And a surprising number haven\rquote 
t bothered to restart.  They are just letting the main of their land and buildings and working away 
from the farm. Most farms, if not all farms that have restocked around here have increased and in some cases, doubled their stock number which in my opinion isn\rquote 
t that good for the industry. As I still think that the smaller family farm would be better, if they could only be made viable again.  FMD only seems to have made it harder for the smaller farmer, especially the ones that didn\rquote t get FMD.

The Government seems to be doing more to make it know that they will not be making compensation payments like that again.  Rather than doing something to prevent the disease from entering the country again. As far as I am aware they still haven\rquote 
t traced where it came from.  They seem to be more concerned about how to control an outbreak in the future rather than stop
ping it in the first place.  (Prevention is always better than cure). It seems to me that they may be preparing us for further outbreaks as we grow nearer to the E.U. of this and other diseases that at the moment we have eradicated.
\par To continue on a differ
ent note, I think the FMD has created an amount of jealousy and resentment in the farming community and the businesses around it.  Due to some of the large amounts of compensation being talked about by some farmers. Most people seem to feel that the farme
rs and other businesses that didn\rquote 
t have the disease have suffered a lot more and for a lot longer than those who had FMD. Terrible although it was for them at the time.  But looking around now I think that, these feelings of resentment and possible the new
 movement restrictions are about all there is still visible of the diseases.  But as time passes I think it will all still fade into history as it has before.
