I remember hearing about it on the news and then one day a trip over to the north-east for my mum and my brother and seeing the end of a farm lane and thinking what\rquote s going on, why have they got
 straw put there, what are they doing?  Not being able to understand what it was all about to start with.  And then sort of mum explained what it was all about disinfectant and everything and I thought oh.  Its almost like its nothing to do with us becaus

\fs24\insrsid15093450 ) so suddenly there\rquote s one or two lads saying they couldn\rquote t get back home, they still had to have driving tests, and they couldn\rquote t back, they didn\rquote t want to go
 back home.  One of the nearest farms round this area was taken me daughter, so she wouldn\rquote t go back home, she stayed in town.  As soon as they found out we had Foot & Mouth they rang up and said, \'93just stay at home\'94
 otherwise she would have to miss school.  Er, so it affected, she stayed in town so she was able to carry on like.  Some of the farm lads they went home at the weekend at the end of the week and they never returned (}{\fs24\insrsid3872273 ?}{
\fs24\insrsid15093450 ) but it did give us some breathing space shall we say.  Er,  me best mates a farmer his now farming a fourth generation on the farm, yeah.  At first um, well the fact (}{\fs24\insrsid3872273 ?}{\fs24\insrsid15093450 
) but um, a certain amount of tipping but um, there was suddenly (}{\fs24\insrsid3872273 ?}{\fs24\insrsid15093450 ) we couldn\rquote t complete the games properly.  Some people went missing of course.  The presentation
 end of the season there was a helper till September (}{\fs24\insrsid3872273 ?}{\fs24\insrsid15093450 ). And they were saying suddenly we couldn\rquote t go on the lake.  In courtesy to the farmers we could\rquote ve still gone, we couldn\rquote 
t back off and we put it off for a few months.  Um, but it was more out of courtesy really.  So it does affect \'85.. talking on and on.  Me friend for example with his (}{\fs24\insrsid3872273 ?}{\fs24\insrsid15093450 ) at first although he didn\rquote 
t actually have Foot & Mouth, he was next door to it, so his caught in the area.  At first he was a bit, you know, easy ride about it, cause he\rquote 
d been five years previous, well BSE.  And then this came on top of it.  And then next minute he got called back, its too much, you couldn\rquote t speak to him.

Well he could speak but you know he was down in the dumps he was really low.  In fact he wouldn\rquote t clean his own farm, he was just so \'85\'85  Now he looks back, he says, \'93I was a bloody fool I should have took the money for the farm\'94
.  But he just didn\rquote t want to know it.  Because, can you imagine fourth generation.  But then he looked at it through different eyes.  Now his um, took the opportunity.  His son\rquote 
s not bothering to farm, so he decided as soon as his time come to come off it.  But he still kept some lambs cause he always, [mumble].  But the main farm he just (}{\insrsid15623850 ?}{\insrsid15093450 
) a week ago now.  So meself yeah, I suppose it just goes on little bits and pieces that it affects.  But you were asking at the beginning I sort of jumped first of all.  But at first you just (}{\insrsid15623850 ?}{\insrsid15093450 
).  Er, it were a bit strange, whereas I think I\rquote ve seen as regards the smell it doesn\rquote t bother us.  I\rquote ve seen rotten corpses I can\rquote t even traumatise, I don\rquote 
t understand.  You know few people get traumatised personally and so I\rquote m a bit strange on that.  (}{\insrsid15623850 ?}{\insrsid15093450 ) Cause the attitude years ago, you didn\rquote t tell, but nowadays \'93how do you feel about?\'94 (}{
\insrsid15623850 ?}{\insrsid15093450 ).  People get shot and so what do they do?  They stick a mike in front of them and say, \'93how do you feel about it?\'94  Well am I supposed to feel badly about it?  Or do you say, \'93well thank God it wasn\rquote 
t me?\'94  If you talk to a soldier from the war you only look round, I mean somebody got shot beside him, you just say, \'93that\rquote s him not me\'94.  You have to take a different attitude and if you\rquote ve been brought up with that attitude \'85

\b0\insrsid15093450 that was all stopped just bits and pieces more pleasure.  To me directly on another side but the tipping of animals didn\rquote 
t bother me.  On that side as I think I said earlier on er, I felt upset about er friends that were having problems with it, I felt for them, but you felt hopeless you couldn\rquote t do anything.  The best
 you can do is just talk, which is where, which is, I think somebody said one of the best things that came out is that people started talking again.  A lot of people drifted apart, some of them came closer together }{\b0\insrsid6582771 that\rquote s good

 people unite.  I think the classic case of course is the II World War down in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}London{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}.  Er, he\rquote s an exam \'85\'85 you see }{\b0\insrsid6582771

 during the Blitz he was in the army he was wounded very early on and in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}London{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} they are dropping bombs all over the place.  All r
ight all streets been decimated and he comes back up here for a weekend and (183) at the time and they said, \'93B}{\b0\insrsid6582771 ar }{\b0\insrsid15093450  Bill you missed it last week they dropped a bomb on a farmhouse up the vale\'94
 and they were excited about it.  And his thinki }{\b0\insrsid6582771 \'93}{\b0\insrsid15093450 bloody hell, he\rquote d seen whole areas just decimated.  And they was so concerned.  You see the Blitz didn\rquote

\b0\insrsid15093450 s gonna come back, still being careful really, you do what you want to do.

\par 
\par }{\b0\insrsid2691248 G }{\b0\insrsid15093450 Um, well pretty much the same as H said basically all of it.  One of the points we haven\rquote 
t touched on yet um, which was just at the time the roads the roads being closed, not being able to get anywhere.  Because there was one day in particular sort of like, which way do you go?  And adding all the extra mileage on your destinat
ion, having to sort of find the next nearest route.  And also which still at the moment the holes in the roads.  Um, and the other thing that really annoyed me was the drivers of the big companies, of the big lorries the roads are not that wide and you me
et one of them you\rquote ve got no chance.  So you just \'85\'85
 they think they own the roads you know the drivers, and they just, well they still do, I mean they still fly round the corners.  So yeah there was a lot of that sort of thing going on last year.  And as I
 say the roads are still in pretty bad shape now, there\rquote s a big great hole at the moment just passed the abattoir.   And um, it}{\b0\insrsid2691248 \rquote }{\b0\insrsid15093450 s er one of the bad things is the roads.
\par 
\par }{\insrsid15093450 Mmmmm so it was quite frightening walking around?

\par }{\insrsid2691248\charrsid2691248 G}{\b0\insrsid2691248  }{\b0\insrsid15093450 Well yeah mmmm.  Well not being able to walk was one of the things but driving anywhere was um, there was quite a few occasions where er, }{\b0\insrsid2691248 I }{
\b0\insrsid15093450 had to break quite sharply.

s going on, your anxious and you don\rquote t know what\rquote s actually happening at the site. You don\rquote t know what\rquote s (230) how long for because people come to see you and they couldn\rquote 
t get to yer, you just being anxious all the time.  And even now  you still don\rquote t really know what\rquote s gonna happen in the future, there are so many things unanswered really.  But where do you start really cause this thing doesn\rquote 
t really happen all the time.  So you can\rquote t expect people to have answers for everything.  But you know stuff like this [mumble] but that was the worst thing just }{\b0\insrsid2691248 lack of }{\b0\insrsid15093450  information}{\b0\insrsid2691248 
, finding things out on the news, }{\b0\insrsid15093450  that you really should have known, the community should have known that something was going to happen so close instead of finding out on the news and no-one knows anything.  I think that was the wo
