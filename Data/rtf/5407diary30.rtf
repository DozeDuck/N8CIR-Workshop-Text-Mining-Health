\par Seeing as this is the first week!
\par Foot and Mouth lives with me every day.  I did my first valuation in March 2001 and my last in October.  Every single day at work is affected by it.  Livestock markets are going to be so \'93regulated\'94
 it hardly makes sense.  Many people believe it is a high level attempt to get rid of us.
\par 
\par I visited two farms this week on which both farmers burst into tears.  One lost his sheep but kept his cows.  He cried buckets telling me how they slaughtered his lambs.  The other is restocking and I went to see his new co
ws.  He sobbed when talking about the dreaded day.
\par 
\par If only the general public and politicians could see the mental effect F&M has had on our community, maybe they could do more to help.  It is not the money!  It goes way beyond that!

\par Afternoon meeting at Farmer Y\rquote s.  They started giving me a hard time.  I got mad rather than upset.  Sometimes I think that they haven\rquote t a clue what is going on.  I didn\rquote

\par Afternoon \endash  To the Accountants with our Chairman.  There is the possibility of a major deal coming up for our firm.  It worries me.  No such thing as a job for life.  I know from our Chairman\rquote s past history that he would have no qualms a
bout sending me \lquote down the road\rquote .  He told me he once sacked 7000 people in one day.  I used to think I was a good Auctioneer, now I\rquote

M. One of them became tearful recounting how they had to give up all of their sheep. This turned to anger when he recalled DEFRA putting enormous pressure on his teenage son to allow them to inspect the farm whilst his father was away for the evening. DEF
RA rang several times that day refusing to accept the boys request for them to wait until his dad came home the following morning. \'93We were treated like criminals \'93 he said
\par 
\par My firm did not even do their valuation. Privately the older brother apologised to 
me saying his brother was insistent that another firm did the valuation because they were willing to give more money for the sheep than we would. I said it was water under the bridge but at the time we were rather hurt especially as another brother is a c
o
lleague of ours. Money always talks. I treated every valuation in the most professional way I could. I would not give more than my professional judgement allowed and I ended up losing business because of it! There was never much gratitude at the end of th
e day which I do understand. I am not asking for it. I just get brassed off when farmers moan about their valuations How little they got, or how prices went up after they had been valued. Nobody ever says \'93 tell us what it was like for you A\'94
 That must be human nature I suppose.

but I get a bit waylaid sometimes. Pressure is a funny thing. In a perverse way I need it to be at my best. Yet it is bloody hard to live with it. My god I am feeling it now but at least for the right reasons. Not like last year when the downward spiral I
 was living under gradually dragged me down with it. It is taking a long time to bounce back.

ne man has only once ventured out of his village since foot and mouth. He never felt like he could go anywhere. He longs for the opening of the new mart because he will have to make the effort to visit us. This he really wants to do. May be a new beginnin
g for him too. We talked along time about the possibility of him giving up dairy farming. He is in his late 50\rquote 
s but his son is not interested in milking cows. His herd is just about too small to classed as viable. He wants to sell the cows but feels very g

\par 
\par Sleeping fitfully at the moment. Really feeling the pressure
. Meeting with DEFRA. Yet again they refused to give a licence to operate. They found some new problems which they thought were ok last week. IT is ridiculous. They are justifying their own existence. They insisted that we lay more concrete at the back of
 the building. It made me so mad after all this time.
\par

\par 
\par The day before. Last minute preparations. AT 8pm DEFRA came back to give us the licence. They thought it was funny to make us wait that long. It is insulting really. They have cost me \'a32000 in extra costs this week alone. Is that fair?
\par

\par 
\par Friday 24}{\fs24\super\insrsid13847791 th}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  May
\par 
\par The big day. To work by 7am as the stock came in. DEFRA officials being totally stupid demanding that my men zip up their water proofs to the top in case
 there is infection present. It is a complete joke. One wrong word from me and they take my licence away. Now that is power is it not?
\par 
\par Other than that a great day. The market flowed as smooth as we could have hoped for, the trade was good and people came 
from all over the country. In short we made it ! after all this time and especially the last year I was back doing the job I was really trained to do. How I enjoyed being in that rostrum. It was superb.
\par 
\par Drove home at 9 pm tired, exhausted, emotionally and
 physically drained. Felt a glow of satisfaction because I achieved what I always said I could do. Not just me obviously but all of out team. We have been to hell and back within the last year. Now may be at last we have turned the corner. Let us hope so.

his reputation. I reminded him of when he had to give his sheep up on the 3k cull. Someone had advised him to get another firm of valuers because we were not the valuers prepared to give most money. He had been told that another firm were \'93

\par In the garden most of the day and got sunburned while weeding. Then to Cockermouth with the band to play at the wedding of an old school friend. Quite a good gig really and saw some people I had not seen since school days. One girl who I remember as being
 particularly dowdy had turned in to quite a stunning creature. She probably looked at me and thought what a particularly fat and old individual I had turned in to. So who has had the best deal then?

\par

\par 
\par In the
 evening I played in the annual village football match. The first 18 stone centre forward in history. What do you know, I actually thundered in a goal from 35 years. No honestly I did! My wife who was watching the proceedings could not believe it although
 she was more amused by the fact that none of the village shirts would go over my neck. I had to wear my own rugby shirt.  A really good day but could hardly walk home for being do tired and stiff. Tomorrow I will suffer.

\par Now the farmers of Penrith are dismayed. They
 can not accept the loss of their mart. Where will they trade? Where can they go to meet their friends to catch up on news, educate themselves, meet their business suppliers? This has all been wiped out in an instant. 
\par 
\par The truth is that the marts cannot sustain themselves. }{\fs24\insrsid5457195 Y }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 has gone quickly because there is precious little stock left to sell in the area since foot and mouth. Also they made their own business mistakes.

\par 
\par It does however leave a big void in the lives of the farmers. They either have to trave
l to a distant mart which of course adds to the costs of selling animals. Or they go the route the Government is desperate to push the farmers down by dealing direct with the Supermarkets big buyers. How they will be laughing and relieved at the demise of
 the marts. Soon they will be naming their price for the stock they buy. Just like last year when the marts were all closed. Lambs were about \'a315 per head less than they are now. How much proof do you need.
\par 
\par So who will be next? At lea}{\fs24\insrsid16410653 s}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 t another two marts w
ill disappear or be swallowed up shortly in the county of Cumbria. Left high and dry after foot and mouth. Those of us who can survive are being crippled by ridiculous DEFRA rules that cost us increased labour costs and loss of business because farmers tr
ying to restock cannot sell through a mart for 20 days after their last purchase, They can however send their animals direct to a slaughter house.
\par 
\par Do you see a pattern emerging here. }{\fs24\insrsid5457195 Y }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 mart is huge loss to the 
faring community both in business and social terms. I worry about what the true effect will be on farmers. The mart closure will be a burden for them to carry. Some will not carry it well. I fear the worst for them.
\par 
\par Meanwhile we soldier on, resenting what is happening to our business by Government Policy. Make no bones about it, the blame for the loss of the Mart can be to a certain extent be put at DEFRA\rquote s door.

\par Sale day and a difficult
 day being a slaughter market. This was our first one. Farmers tied up on 20 days of which there are a growing number at this time can only sell in an auction if the animals go direct to slaughter. Normally we run a general market which means animals can 
be brought home. 
\par 
\par The slaughter market did not go well. Not much extra business but some sheep were a bad trade because they were too lean. Mixed reactions from the farmers. Whose fault is it? Guess ! Bloody DEFRA. What a stupid rule
\par 
\par Home to look after kids as P went for a run .she is really in to this and is looking good. Makes me feel worse. Fat slob. I use the excuse of being too busy, but it is not an excuse really.  I will go back to the Gym eventually\'85\'85\'85\'85..

\par A big}{\fs24\insrsid16410653 ,}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  big day. To work early. The sheep look marvellous in the auction, but I am too nervous to really take it in. welcome some new buyers who have not been to Cockermouth show.
\par 
\par The sheep are judged and a young farming couple take first place. Judith is delighted}{\fs24\insrsid16410653  }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 .they lost many sheep last year. I valued quite a lot at the time. She hugs me with joy. I wish now I could 
have shared their enjoyment but I was so worried about how I would sell them.
\par 
\par 10am the sale starts. Heart beating I say a few short words of welcome}{\fs24\insrsid16410653  }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 .there is an air of anticipation. My heart is thumping. The first pen of lambs in are decent sorts. They should be worth \'a3

\par 
\par The sheep make \'a3100, one of the best prices in the County this year. The Judge, Les Grainger from Penrith buys them . A big cheer and round of applause goes up. It does not get any better than that.

amily. Another good price and they continue to sell pen after pen of quality animal. The run of lambs I have ever sold. I call Geoff Smith over and congratulate him
\par 
\par Soon I remember that my colleague will want to sell. Reluctantly but with good grace I call him on to the rostrum. He takes over where I leave. I walk around the auction as high as a kite. It is going great.
\par 
\par At last the sale is over but farmers seem to stay around for ages. We have had a real sale, the buzz continues long after the close of tr
ading. Many words of praise for the auction are given by the new buyers. We have got it right they say. What relief, what joy. We are well and truly back.

\par

\par What a hangover. Stumbled to breakfast with my room mate  who was worse than me. Lots of bleary eyes at the conference,
\par 
\par Became clear that a lot of auctioneers are doing very badly since foot and mouth. There is a growing belief among the auctioneers that there is a definite government policy to eradicate our business. If it is true (and I now believe it is) then how sadl

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 My God, December is upon us already. It is Christmas beef show week. Always big stress time. We have a g
ood entry this year. Our cattle numbers have been building quite well but we are well down on sheep mostly due to foot and mouth losses. I always said it would take at least three years to recover, in reality we may never truly recover
\par 
\par An amazing day real
ly. Collected some lambs in the auction for a private sale to an abattoir. The price was agreed between the parties on Saturday. The farmer turned up with  the sheep and refused to sell them at the agreed price. He demanded more money. I could not give hi
m
 more money. So he went crackers accusing me of swindling him and starting to put his sheep back on the trailer. I calmed him down and asked him what the hell was wrong. Turns out that another auction had rung him for lambs. Having been beaten by us they 
then tried to sabotage the job by saying they would have given him more money. A real bastards trick
\par 
\par I rang the buyer who quite rightly said that we had an agreed deal. Anyway I got another penny or two out of him having explained the s
ituation but he was not happy. The deal remained in tact and the farmer left in a huff. What a crazy world we live in. the harder we try the harder it gets.

\par To work early and some good quality cattle on offer. Judge drove up from Manchester. A real good show and sale with over 100 cattle in. hard work with a bad throat but enjoyed it.
\par 
\par Farmers had a bit 
of a session in the afternoon. Then in to the evening. I sat in but did not drink. Every one seemed to enjoy it. Several said they had looked forward to this day for many months being the first Xmas do since foot and mouth. Last year there were no auction

Bureaucracy}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  has gone mad. It is about at its worst in the farming industry. People will have a right to roam yet a farmer does not have the right to sell or even move his stock around his farm if it had been purchased in. 
\par 
\par Lu
nchtime visit with a colleague to a solicitors in Carlisle. They have invited us to lunch as a PR exercise. There were other professionals there also. Andrew and I thought it a worthwhile exercise and decided that we must follow suit. It was a good relati

. The farmers are running it themselves so they have very few wages to pay. Consequently they are boasting about how much money they are making and how well they are doing. So my d

that it is the farmers OWN market. In reality they are struggling to cope and have their own problems which most people will not know about.

\par Hurrah, out on farms in the  morning. A good trip up the Ennerdale valley. It was freezing with a very cold east wind blowing. Back to office about lunch time then a meeting with the DEFRA vets. This is a so called lia}{\fs24\insrsid3023633 i}{
\fs24\insrsid13847791 son meeting so that they can take feedback from us back to Page Street. The idea is great in principle except the vets admitted that Page }{\fs24\insrsid1991415 S}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
treet does not really take any notice. Apparently it works off its own agenda.
\par 
\par We made it very clear what effect the 20 day rule and other regulations were doing to us. The stupid thing is the vets knew exactly what 
we were saying for they hear it every day from everybody connected to agriculture. They will pass it on but Page street will take no notice. It is so absolutely bloody frustrating. Then they wonder why so many farmers are breaking the law. It is crazy

\par 
\par Home then to a meeting for a proposed new after school club. This will help our kids when they get to school. We cannot pick them up every day. Ended up going on the committee
\par  Because not many others would. They all want a club but don\rquote t want to do any work for it\'85\'85\'85..

\par 
\par Sheep Christmas prize show. Sold 50 or so cattle then 2500 sheep. Got quite irate with some farmers who were moaning about better prices at }{\fs24\insrsid1991415 Y}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
. They had been told this by a farmer who hardly uses our mart but goes to }{\fs24\insrsid1991415 Y}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 . H
e was telling people they should go past us. This was a man who swore allegiance when the mart was being built. I reminded him and an argument ensued. One farmer suggested we use one of the buyers who went bust during foot and mouth. There is no bad debt 
i
nsurance against him now. So that farmer got told how little they know about the business. It is just plain greed. The farmers will sell their soul for an extra penny. That is what shut the markets in Ireland when the meat buyers got together and offered 
a penny more to farmers who sold direct off the farm and cut the marts out. The marts died and then the buyers reduced the prices systematically leaving the farmers moaning that they were missing the marts.
\par 
\par I rather enjoyed getting it off my chest when arguing with the farmers. \'93Use us or lose us\'94 is going to be the motto.

\fs24\insrsid13847791 and then let the farmers set their own market up in the auction. Much venom against the board. But they have sworn allegiance to the new }{\fs24\insrsid1991415 Y }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 farmers business which down very well.

\par 
\par Afternoon drive with a Lancashire meat buyer all the way to Berwick. 3 0 clock when we got there and all ready going dark. The farmer had invited us up to buy some cattle direct off the farm. He was not a mart
 customer but had family links to us. The drive up was a favour to the meat buyer who is a good customer.
\par 
\par The farmer decided before we even walked in the sheds that he did not want to sell until after Christmas so the buyer could not even bid him a price.
 It was a waste of time really. So we drove all the way back home again. 240 mile round trip for nothing. Home at 7-30 pm. Kids in bed. They both have chicken pox. The spots have just come. I knew they had been under the weather for a few days poor mites.

 DEFRA was interrupted by an aggressive individual who turned out to be one of the top brass from London. He told me he was sick of DEFRA being blamed and criticised about absolutely everything. I asked him if he was prepared t
o listen and take justifiable criticism. He said he was so I gave him both barrels\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85
.christ did I enjoy it. He never got a word in . I recounted the tale of my first valuation and the young vet who knew what had to be done but got no back up from Page Street.
\par I told him I held DEFRA wholly responsible for the spread of the disease and shame on the lot of them for not listening to what they were told
\par 
\par His answer was that it was not DEFRA\rquote s fault at all. It was the treasury who refused in the early days to fund the necessary steps. I was gobsmacked\'85\'85\'85
\par 
\par After a while I said \'93Don\rquote t you all play for the same team then?\'94 he shrugged his shoulders
\par 
\par After that I changed my attack by telling him that they were supposed to lead and advise farmers not work against
 them. He agreed. So I invited him to make a first conciliatory step by accepting my invitation to come to the Lake District to meet the farmers who were being hammered by current and proposed policy changes. He gave me his personal card and I promised hi
m that I would contact him. At that point I was joined by Will Cockbain former NFU chairman who told me that this guy was one of the big cheeses in London but he still didn\rquote 
t trust him anyway. Time will tell. My invitation stands. Still it was good to get a few verbal right hooks into the bugger\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85..

no idea were Diarists. One I have played rugby with several times, neither of us knowing that we were involved. I also had no idea that he too had been through the mill like the rest of us in 2001. As I keep saying in my book, \'93
ever one has their own story to tell\'94
\par 
\par Got a real eye opener at the meeting. The study is going to be fantastic.  Suddenly realised that it will be the last chance to set the record straight as far as F & M 2001 goes. I hope it gets as much publicity as possible. We must show the wor
ld what happened and why\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85.

\par 
\par Spoke to my friend }{\fs24\insrsid5514504  }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 high up on Birker Moor where she farms with husband. They were taken out as D Cs }{\fs24\insrsid12587001 (Dangerous Contacts) }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
during F & M despite the fact that they were miles from any infection. She rang
 me one Saturday morning and screamed hysterically for several seconds. I had to get her to ring me back when she had calmed down. They needed me to go and value and I could not because I was in the Penrith area and had 6 appointments that day. I had to p
ass her on to another auction firm and felt so very guilty.
\par 
\par They lost everything and I should have been there. Months later when it was all over I plucked up courage and rang }{\fs24\insrsid5514504 C }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 to apologise for not being there. It had prayed on my mind. She understood and 
bore no grudge but I still feel that I let them down. Last spring when I went back to the farm for the first time Dennis broke down as I tried to discuss the day with him. Even then having restocked the memories were all too painful.
\par 
\par C}{\fs24\insrsid5514504  }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 told me to day she 
is not well. She has contracted Multiple Sclerosis. She is forty years old with teenage children. She had been unwell long before foot and mouth. the doctors now say she had it even then but it has only manifest itself when the stress post F & M has eased
. During that time her mental and physical barriers were able to hold the disease at bay. Now it has got her just as life was returning to a more normal state. 
\par 
\par She says already she cannot walk properly. Her arms and legs tingle all the time. Her neck is so stiff she cannot turn her head.
\par 
\par I feel very sorry for her but she says not to worry, she might not be able to beat it but she will not make it easy for it. What courage\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85..
\par 
\par Problems? What problems do I have compared to that?  \'93Life\rquote s a bitch and then\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85..\'94

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 Kids took part in the fancy dress and village sports. They were Shrek and Princess }{\fs24\insrsid6167878 F}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
. The mums and Dads got it straight away and I could hear them commenting how brill their costumes were. Sadly the judges were ancient and thought }{\fs24\insrsid13788832 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  was \'93a jolly green Giant\'94
 no prizes for us then. }{\fs24\insrsid10096868 [daughter]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  won the under fives egg and spoon. }{\fs24\insrsid13788832 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
 came last in the under fives running race. He was two last week. He says he is going to come back bigger and stronger next year and kick ass.
\par 
\par I did not go in the }{\fs24\insrsid12587001 D}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 ads race because I am  a fat \'85\'85\'85. I came 4}{\fs24\super\insrsid13847791 th}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  last year after a deliberate false start. No one argued though.

\par  The year before }{\fs24\insrsid13788832 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  made me go down to watch the sports but I would not take part and would only watch from a distance. Seems funny now but I genuinely felt that I was leper at that time. I felt dirt
y and actually was dirty according to DEFRA or MAFF as it was then. Time is a great healer. I\rquote ve said that before
\par 
\par Played in the Dads v lads annual soccer match. Well I came on as a sub. They didn\rquote t have a shirt big enough for me so I wore my own .not for the first time did I surprise them with my pace and skill. As one kid said,

\par All around the 
Eskdale valley this morning. Used to do 7 valuations up the valley. Now do four. One farmer died, one moved on, the other lost a lot of stock in F & M and has not needed a valuation since. It is sad because this day used to be my favourite day of the year
.
 Eskdale is under threat from ESA and the National trust who seem to specialise in putting unsuitable tenants on to their farms nowadays. It makes me mad and the local farming families who are being invaded but persons simply not used to the fell  shepher
ds way of life. There is much resentment. Hardly enjoyed my day
\par 
\par Evening meeting with the Herdwick Sheep breeders about marketing schemes. VAC have pots of money to spend. How often have we heard that one. They have all these fantastic ideas about a communi
ty scheme to sell sheep meat. The usual rubbish which is fine on paper. To sell the scheme they referred several times to how bad prices have been in the auctions in some years. 
\par 
\par Of course I could not take that so said my piece about how bloody good price
s had been in the auctions and how bad they were when there were no auctions in F & M. Widespread murmurs of approval  from the farmers of course. Finished by telling VAC they damn well should be trying to help existing marketers like ourselves get going 
again after F & M. \'93 Can\rquote t do that because of state aid rules\'94  B*******!!!!!!
\par 
\par Upshot is that VAC want me to join there think tank committee to take the proposal forward\'85\'85\'85ah progress-------maybe!

\par 
\par What a morning say work. We were invade
d by a nest of local councillors and the Mayoress. Our building is up for a design and construction award. We designed I and the contractors constructed. If it wins then the contractors get a big high profile award and prize money. We get bugger all havin
g spent hours and hours getting our design and layout perfect. Apparently it is a Construction Industry award and can not be awarded to an auction company. I am sick and want to emigrate. Whenever seem to get any recognition for what we have achieved.

\par 
\par Then the MLC boss turned up to have a look around the new market. He had a tight schedule and by the time I had kissed the lady Mayoress goodbye he had already disappeared. GREAT!
\par 
\par Then a man turned up for a meeting he was supposed to come to last week but never turned up. Moaned because he had come all the way from the North East!!!

\par 
\par P had spent all last night on teletext getting holiday details. So she has booked a holiday to Menorca. We leave on Saturday. Can\rquote

\par 
\par Roll on Saturday. Loads of work to get through before then. }{\fs24\insrsid10096868 [daughter]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  is so excited already and }{\fs24\insrsid13788832 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  has been flying round the garden shouting \'93

\par Big build up to holiday fortnight. Trying to get so much done beforehand. It is a bit frantic especially with the news that }{\fs24\insrsid5457195 Y}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 \rquote s Blackpool abattoir has/ is going bust. The receivers a
re in or so they say! We did not trade with them so we are in the clear. Many other auctioneers will be sleeping badly at night. What a very strange situation. The meat industry in this country is in a very queer state. I believe that the government is de
liberately doing nothing about it. I will try and find out more from the DEFRA man on Friday.
\par 
\par Thursday 19}{\fs24\super\insrsid13847791 th}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  June
\par 
\par Last office day and then an evening dinner with the DEFRA man (Alan) and Andrew Humphries. Two academics and one limited auctioneer. I was out of my depth really. Very impressed with Andrew. His knowledge of Farming in Cumbria is massive especially on the
 
hills. He has a very quiet studious approach. I observed and learned. Alan was more of a problem. He is very senior in DEFRA, knows nothing about farming or rural life and is in charge of a department that will make future policy and shape the lives of fa
r
mers in the future. It was distressing and down hearting. The man brimmed with the power of his position, the excitement of what he felt he could achieve overflowed. He talked of clean air and water, clean farms and orchids. All night he talked of orchids
 in fields. Farmers are going to have to play the environmental game or face the wrath of DEFRA. Regulation and control will be the name of the game.
\par 
\par I asked him who was going to guide the farmers. He thought guidance would not come in to it. He is looking
 forward to making farmers supply detailed information about their businesses by computer. A paper based system would be more costly. He wondered auctioneers could help in the on-line process.
\par 
\par It became apparent that regional variations in farming, way of life and tradition count for very little in his book. Farmers are not good business planners or so he thinks. Farmers will need to adapt or fall by the way side. 
\par 
\par I told him that this was so radical in thought farmers would need great help to achieve the
ir aims. Although it just might work if they are earning a decent living. Without that farmers would not put environment high on the agenda if they were struggling. DEFRA does not owe farmers an existence was his repost. My heart sank.
\par 
\par After the meal I had a brief word with }{\fs24\insrsid8470159 AH}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 . We both agreed that a man with such forceful a purpose and with so little knowledge and understanding of our County and its people was indeed dangerous.
\par 
\par I resolved to try and find what made the man tick the next day.
\par 
\par Friday 20}{\fs24\super\insrsid13847791 th}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  June
\par 
\par Met Alan the DEFRA man at the auction. Showed him around the mart and tried to explain what we were trying to achieve. He admitted that he was impressed but was careful not to show much emotion. I already knew he was a non \endash  believer.
\par 
\par To Will and Louise Rawlings farm in Ennerdale. As we drove up he tut tutted at a pile of pallets and some old machinery at the side of the drive. He told me that soon they would have that classed as an illegal waste dump. I was astounded.
\par 
\par Within five minutes he had mentioned it to Will. He nearly exploded and quite rightly said that if that was going to be DEFRA\rquote a approach it was very, very silly. It was heard by deaf ears. He was right and that was that.
\par 
\par Will and Louise spoke very, very well and got across very salient point about limited opportunities on Lake District hill farms. Alan wanted to know about how they plan their business as policies change. The farmer}{\fs24\insrsid12669071 \rquote }{
\fs24\insrsid13847791 s response was that it didn\rquote t matter what the policy change, they could do little but farm sheep in Ennerdale. It did not seem to sink in. he took it that they meant that they were reluctant to change their traditional ways
\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85he missed the point.
\par 
\par Next we moved on to farm near Calder Bridge. }{\fs24\insrsid8470159 [farmer]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  showed him 15 years of accounts since he started farming on his own in 1986 as a 26 year ol}{\fs24\insrsid8470159 d. He said much the same as W}{
\fs24\insrsid13847791  had. }{\fs24\insrsid8470159 [he]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
 got the point across very well that diversification was a non- starter on their farm. He also talked about what sort a legacy he would want to leave in farming terms for his children. I think Alan actually took notice and listened.
\par 
\par Soon we were at }{\fs24\insrsid8470159  }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 Wasdale. An even harder farm. They found it hard to get the}{\fs24\insrsid12669071 i}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
r message across but similar themes were coming out. We can do little else but farm sheep on these fells. If you want to maintai
n them as they are we need to make a living. But Alan does not want to maintain them. He wants to see wild orchids and bluebells in abundance. He wants the fells to be naturalised. He has been under the influe}{\fs24\insrsid4006898 n}{
\fs24\insrsid13847791 ce of English Nature it is plainly obvious.
\par 
\par A
fter a light lunch we headed into the Duddon valley, the scene of an almighty disaster during foot and mouth when the valley was virtually denuded of sheep. I was there then and my bitterness at the situation as we drove past was clearly evident. I got my
 message across. I was right and there was nothing he could say.
\par 
\par We drove to farm at Turner Hall. }{\fs24\insrsid8470159 [farmer]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
 was far more eloquent than I expected. He shocked Alan by telling him that there were no wild flowers or the like on the fells. There had not been in 4 generations of }{\fs24\insrsid8470159 [family] }{\fs24\insrsid13847791 
on the farm. If the sheep all disappeared it would revert to naturally regenerated scrub, heather and gorse. No orchids\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85\'85
\par 
\par }{\fs24\insrsid8470159 [farmer]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  told Alan that conservation and management was very important to him on his land. He would like to do more but was constrained by a lack of staff because he could not afford to hire a full time man 
or three as the farm used to carry. More profit would bring more conservation etc. nicely put. 
\par 
\par Finally he mentioned a constant theme that day, \'93The right to roam\'94 I had not appreciated the depth of feeling amongst farmers in Cumbria. Alan was unrepentant. The public has the right end of story. Anthony asked what if he roamed around Alan
\rquote s garden for a day. Alan said that it was his personal property. }{\fs24\insrsid8470159 [farmer]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  told him the farm was his property. Not so said Alan. This country side belongs to the people- or words to that effect.
\par 
\par As we left we saw some very good Herdwick sheep. }{\fs24\insrsid8470159 [farmer]}{\fs24\insrsid13847791  explained what difficulty he had had in showing them at the breeders \'93May\'94
 fair at which he shows off his best tups which will be sold in the Autumn.
\par 
\par Alan felt that the rule
s and regs imposed were done so under the best scientific advice DEFRA could get. I asked him if he had read the report M had prepared with regard to regs and bio-security. He had glanced at it but not in detail. Not his department. He was good at saying 
that when we pressured him on certain anomalies of legislation such as illegal imports etc etc. not his department. The same answer was given when I pressed him on how DEFRA might improve their PR with farmers.
\par 
\par So back to Cockermouth and on the way we stop
ped on the top of Birker Moor to look down on Eskdale and across the  Scafells, Great Gable and the massif of the Wetern Lake District. All magnificent sheep country, with a panorama made by farmers in the production of food. In doing so, giving the count
ry the Lake District that they love. Sadly Alan\rquote s thoughts were with nitrate pollution and the damage done by sheep to the ecology. He seemed so unimpressed.
\par 
\par As we drove home I asked why so many senior people in DEFRA were anti auction mart. His exact answer sticks in my mind. 
\par \'93we believe that mart represents an unnecessary link in the meat chain. They also increase the risk of the spread of infectious diseases\'94 I glanced to see if he was reading from the DEFRA manual. He was not. I asked him whether from 
what he had seen during the day he thought that my role and standing in the Cumbrian farming community was unnecessary. He admitted that he could say that I played a very good role within the exceptional area that is the Lake District. He would not howeve
r give one inch on the disease risk issue. I argued that the risk was minimal in peace time. Sadly he was not he said qualified to comment on the issue.
\par 
\par Back at the mart we said brief goodbyes. I did not really know how to comment, so I thanked him for tak
ing the time to come and learn. I said that my sincere wish was that DEFRA could try and make life easier for farmers whatever the policy of the day was.
\par 
\par I drove home with lifted spirits knowing that I was going on holiday but knowing that I would have to go home and face thinking about my day with Alan of DEFRA.
\par 
\par It is now evident that policy makers are coming from a totally new perspective. It is European in making and it will not favour all countries. It will not favour the farmers of Lakeland. I feel l
ike I would like to get out of the industry. In saying that I feel ashamed and guilty but the writing is on the wall. What a great shame after all we have been through. Farmers do not know what is going to hit them, but I have seen a trailer to the main e
vent. How can I even begin to get the message across? Why should it be my job? Who can I even talk to for guidance????????
