We decided we now need more staff, a new vet and a part time receptionist, this could take us back up to our previous staffing level pre FM, bar a vet.  But this was probably going to be all the recruitments we would make this year.  It\rquote 
s a good sign As Things begin to get back to normal!!  Work is increasing quite a lot now most of our farmers have restocked, although a lot of them and us are still concerned about the future.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 A difficult day today with licences, two of our farmers needed 
Sole Occupancy Authentitys (SOA) and there were queries with their land, unless some of their fields could be redefined, they were worried their stock would suffer.  During the FM these worries have shown how much they care about their stock and find it v
ery frustrating when they don\rquote t understand why we can\rquote t move them, even to the point of anger and tears.  By the end of the day, thankfully they were resolved, with compromise on both sides and a lot of phone calls.

 it was quite a pile!!  It was interesting looking back and very sad, it makes you realise just how deep the feelings went and although it sounds silly it\rquote s surprisin
g how quickly those feelings can return over the smallest things.  Anyway having done that, it did feel good to box them up and put them away.  We got taken out for lunch with our Ptizer rep and it was nice just to talk about usual! Things, drug competiti

Another busy day and another Caesar, the calf was dead unfortunately.  The cow with query BSE was taken away for tests, which was sad.  My highlight of my day was the farm across fro

 was reading a TT test at a farm and found a reactor.  Pre f+m Cumbria was TB free but with all the new stock co
ming into the area it is inevitable that this will not be the case, there have already been two other cases in the county.  I dropped off the isolation notice to the farmer and as they are, he seemed okay and still very positive.  I have always admired th

The large animal work has been rapidly increasing and it has been putting extra pressure on all the staff, we do really need another vet but anothe
r advert and still no response at all, but they all work very hard and we do manage to get through the work. We chatted to the staff and tried to reassure them about the future but how can you when if we can't get another vet, we simply can't provide the 
service our clients need. It is very worrying and we are not sure of the solution or the future.  I think after that paragraph I need a 'we can do it', kick!!

A new cattle fertility programme has now become available to Vets and farmers. Two of the people who work came along to see us and discuss the advantages . We already had a few farmers keen in having the program installed. We discussed the program later w
i
th a few farmers and they were very keen recognising that they are going to need a program like this that can help them keep a tighter control on their herds fertility and health, which would enable them to remain in business. As most of them are realisin
g, they are now running a company not a family concern. So it\rquote s quite exciting another step forward hopefully.

ording, the farm I go to did not get FMD and they were saying how hard it had been for them and to some extent they did have as hard a time as people with FMD, just in different ways they had to do the checking for longer.  The farmer said he used to drea
d
 going into the sheds in a morning as he dreaded what he might find.  Also washing the milk takers, not being able to visit friends and family.  All the regulations re moving stock, just the not knowing they said it put quite a strain on them all.  One of
 the ways they coped was they built a tennis court and played a lot of other games and as a family this brought them closer.

\par Interherd Day - We held a meeting today to invite all the farmers interested in using the programme, the people who wrote the p
rogramme came along to talk to the farmers.  It was very good and the farmers seemed to enjoy themselves.  They have all found they are needing this sort of programme as with the new herds, they are unsure of how their fertilities are.

 re Interherd programme, they are very positive about the future and have a son who is very keen.  I can see a difference in their attitude over the past few months, when I first started going they were unsure they h
ad done the right thing and had seriously debated getting any stock back, if they could cope with the changes and the regulations and paperwork, but as }{\fs24\insrsid3162598 [he]}{\fs24\insrsid16461449 
 said 'he just loves farming' not that he doesn't know anything else he just loves farming.  And now
 they have progressed and working together within the family they have a good system and appear to be enjoying themselves.  The farm has been in the family for generations so financially they can manage.  I hope they make it, they are lovely people and a 
real inspiration.
\par The report on FMD and the recommendations is to be published soon, but from what we have heard so far it doesn't say anything we didn't already know and the recommendations are a little sketchy to say the least, the
y need a good sensible positive protocol for any future outbreak and at present if it all flared up again tomorrow, it would be the same mess. What have we learnt - hopefully time will tell.
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid16461449 Tuesday
\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449  Sad news today, one of our clients who didn't get FMD ha
s decided to give up.  He is on a tenanted farm.  The owners are not keen on any expansion or even repairing old buildings, to remain competitive, he sees he needs more cows but can't build any more sheds.  So in his words he has decided that there is may
be 'more to life\rquote , he is in his mid forties, so he is going to sell up and try something new.  Very brave but sad. 
\par I think this will not be the first of our clients to do this.  Everyone asks about the future and at the moment nothing and nobody is certain
.  Can the smaller farmers keep up?  Will the bigger ones get bigger?  What new regulations and paperwork will be brought in?  Only time will tell.

is having a terrible time with DEFRA. When we did his restocking TT test he had a reactor, so the cow was slaughtered but no lesions were found.  The herd had to be tested again 60 days la
ter and another reactor was found and slaughtered.  Anyway he was due another test in 60 days and this was arranged for 9.00am.  9.00am came and went and at 10.00am he phoned to see what was happening.  They had forgotten, they could come out at 1pm.  No 
g
ood, the last two times they had tested it had taken 6 hours to test the cows and they still needed milked which would mean a very late finish.  Mr graves explained this and was told not to complain he had bought the cows into the country with TB and he w
ould have to do it when they said.  They know how to get people on their side don't they.  Anyway a heated discussion had pursued and eventually sense was seen.  The test was rearranged for another day at 9.00am so fingers crossed.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 T's 7}{\fs24\super\insrsid16461449 th}{\fs24\insrsid16461449  birthday. We have another vet student studying at the moment for 2 weeks. We have had five this year so far and anoth
er before Christmas but she won't stay in the house as she is from Carlisle.  It is nice to have them and it makes us behave but I won't have as many next year.  They have all been interested in the FMD and some had a chance to help out which was an eye o
pener for them.  I spoke to }{\fs24\insrsid13504632 [student]}{\fs24\insrsid16461449 
 about it all, how it affected everyone, what happened and what didn't!!  Now talking about - almost a year from the last case - I don't find it as hard and I think I can hide how emotional it was, but at the time I wasn
't. I was more angry.  I feel now FMD or the aftermath has sadly become everyday life, I don't rush for news on it or yearn information, I think because directly or indirectly we live with it everyday, it all has really become part of our lives.  It is ve
ry difficult to put into words or explain.
\par I also went to visit one of my Interherd farmers in Lancaster; they are very pleased with it and are coping well.  Mrs M}{\fs24\insrsid13504632  }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 
was crushed by the pet cow a month ago and was very lucky.  She had two broken legs, cuts and
 bruises; needless to say the cow has gone to greener pastures.  They are very resilient and are planning for the future and it is nice to be a part of their planning.  I also get proper milky coffee!!!  See so easy pleased.
\par Milk recorded tonight at Mr G's so early morning tomorrow.  I'm still trying to persuade them into Interherd so finger crossed.
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid16461449 Tuesday 
\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 Early morning milk recording failed on the Interherd due to a cow breaking a leg - I have never actually experienced it happening before. I generally 
hear farmers needing a slaughter cert. Or a cow put down to see it and the family's reaction - I was humbled I think is the word.  It was an accident that can happen but the look on their faces was such deep sorrow - the father even places his head in his
 
hands.  At breakfast we all talked about it, she was only a heifer getting ready to be served for the let time, she was a difficult birth, they had all helped, well bred and she was jet black with a huge white spot on her side so no prizes for guessing th
e name.  But as the farmer said you can't look after them, feed them, care for them, day in, day out without caring about them or why would you do it.
\par In the afternoon I attended a course on management.  Employment law, customer service at Barnard Castle, it went on till 9 pm with dinner after so I decided to stay over - very spoilt.  Good course, excellent food, lovely hotel.
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid16461449 Wednesday
\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 Came back from my course leisurely and stopped at Penrith for a bit of shopping - very pleasant. I'm not a good shopper but it was nice. I had to get back for 11 am as 
\par we were having a new credit card machine fitted.  He duly arrived - well what an obnoxious man, he was moaning because we had a switchboard, he had to dial 9, this was wrong, that was wrong and then was he not going to get offered a coffee, to which he wa
s told 'not without the special word', he was a bit aghast and said please.  I swear if I had not just come from a course explaining customer service, I would have murdered him!!  God bless courses and of course credit card machine men!!!
\par In the afternoon I was visited by the RSPCA advertising company, did we want an advert in their leaflet?  Anyway it was \'a3640 for quarter of a page for 2 years so I said we couldn't afford it, it suddenly dropped to \'a3
410, I was a little suspect so I got }{\fs24\insrsid5510380 [receptionist]}{\fs24\insrsid16461449  to qui
etly check if the company were connected to the RSPCA. Anyway while I was waiting I said it was still a little bit more than we could afford what with FMD - see it is useful and true - he then said he could do it for \'a3210, by which time }{
\fs24\insrsid14747596 [she]}{\fs24\insrsid16461449  had confirmed they were with the RSPCA, so I said yes thank you - Bargain or Rip Off!!
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid16461449 Thursday
\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 I tried to get my head round isolation units and tried to explain to a farmer about them. I think we got there eventually.  When }{\fs24\insrsid8216895 [husband]}{\fs24\insrsid16461449  got back I got him to explain in s

\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 I've put these into one as that is how it felt.  After being so confident that we had everything in place to be able to export the sheep first thing Thursday morning DARD (like Irish DEFRA) changed the regulations and pape
rwork - such joy.  As you can imagine this sent everyone in a state of frenzy and another buzby full of phone calls. We didn't have the paperwork sorted when people had bought sheep and were wanting to leave, now some tempers are reaching fever pitch. Wel
l
 we did manage to export them away on Thursday night - 3 hours late so they had to book different ferries. All done and dusted by Friday.  We were busy congratulating ourselves on achieving the impossible and how we all had worked hard to accomplish it an
d
 now had several more names on our Christmas card list - yes you guessed we had a phone call from well let me say one not happy chappy. After having no sleep, catching a late ferry waiting for the paperwork to arrive at Larne port, all the sheep were impo
unded. DARD had added one more form to their list of requirements and had forgotten to send them through or mention them - hours of phone calls and faxing.  Later I am very pleased to say that the sheep were released and free to go.

 It was very encouraging as NMR in the past years have gained themselves a slightly unpopular feel especially in Cumbria but they now seem to see this and are trying very hard and are committed to improving it.  They did a survey and now with area, herd s

was busy but not madly.  The large animal side is very up and down at present, but it is now TT and Blood testing season.  There are quite a lot of restocked herds to do as they are having to be done every year as opposed to 4 yearly.  We also have to tes

Very nice, everything worked well, no mad rushes, time to catch up.  We discussed reducing some of the farm drugs as they are able to buy the over the internet with a prescription.  All the laws and rules will more than likely be ch
anging at the beginning of March due to a report done for the Govt regarding drugs and animal use.  It will make a difference to how we operate as if they remove the vet surgeon\rquote s right
\par to prescribe drugs i.e. vets can only write prescriptions and not dispense drugs \endash 
 it could alter things completely.  One way or another if farmers require the service, they are going to have to pay for it, up to now it has always been that a reasonable mark up is put on the drugs (this is normally 50%) and this will keep pr
ofessional fees down.  If vets are not getting the money made on drugs and therefore has to put his fees up, although the farmer may be buying his drugs cheaper via the internet, will he actually save that much \endash  I wonder.
\par So anyway we have been getting mo
re and more pressure from a number of our farmers to compete with the internet prices. So we have selected a few products and it they pay at the time they can get about 20% off the price.  So watch this space and we will see what happens.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 The week
\par To sum up a blur, with both sad and very funny memories.  To start, }{\fs24\insrsid4617595 [receptionist]}{\fs24\insrsid16461449  was on holiday and it always seems to happen as soon as someone is off, we get very, very busy.  When everyone is in i
t ticks along nicely mostly/  I do enjoy it when it\rquote s busy but we worked 3, 13 hour days \endash  not food but everyone worked really hard, they are excellent staff.
\par On a sad note }{\fs24\insrsid8216895 [vet]}{\fs24\insrsid16461449  went for her 11 week scan on Tuesday and the baby had died, she was distraught.  She has a condition that causes this and this was her 4}{\fs24\super\insrsid16461449 th}{
\fs24\insrsid16461449  miscarriage.  It\rquote s so sad, I called to see her and she just hugged me and cried, what do you say.  She had to have some tablets to clear away the placenta etc. She was gutted as this is the long
est she had ever been pregnant and she thought she\rquote s cracked it.  It\rquote s just so sad.
\par My funny tale for the week on a completely different note, but helped immensely, was (}{\fs24\insrsid4617595 other }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 vet) on Thursday.  We were all very, very busy and a farmer called in, I was ver
y behind, they still had ops to do and this farmer settled herself down for a big chat \endash  normally if I say I have a lot on she departs, but no not today it was obviously my turn.  }{\fs24\insrsid4617595 (vet)}{\fs24\insrsid16461449 
 came over from the op room and I know it was naught}{\fs24\insrsid4617595 y}{\fs24\insrsid16461449  but I wrote on a card \lquote Can I have some help\rquote  \endash  i.e. to free myself.  Well instead of reading the note quietly \endash  oh no \endash 
 she read it out at the top of her voice and added, \'93what do you need help for?\'94  After I had crawled out of the hole that had opened up in the earth to s
wallow me I pointed to the message book to try and hide my predicament while she said again loudly, \'93so what do you want help for?\'94.  Well I gave up and decided to just fall into the hole, got rid of }{\fs24\insrsid4617595 [vet]}{
\fs24\insrsid16461449  back to the op room and continued alone with my predicament.  After the farmer had gone who thankfully seemed oblivious to what had happened, I went in search of }{\fs24\insrsid4617595 [vet]}{\fs24\insrsid16461449 
 to kill her.  Anyway it cheered us all up they do say laughter is the best medicine but I can think of better ways.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 We did some sheep expo

\fs24\insrsid16461449  from University of reading

 record keeping.  So she is going to meet 3 of our farmers who use Interherd and interview them and give them free training so that should please them.

\par Sad news though, we heard one of our farmers}{\fs24\insrsid4617595  }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 dropped down dead suddenly.  It was very sad, as we had seen him in the morning and he was his normal self so it was quite a s

\par We saw the accountant in the afternoon. We had sent 9 months of accounts to him as we need to see how the practice was now doing. Anyway it was not as bad as we thought but the income is down but is slowly growing. The main problem is farmers won\rquote

\par }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 We have had L}{\fs24\insrsid4617595  }{\fs24\insrsid16461449 staying for two weeks. She\rquote s a vet student from London
 and stayed with us about this tine last year. It was interesting to go over the changes from a year ago. Last time she was here people were restocking and there was an element of wariness.
\par So it was interesting to fill her in on how things are now. One th
ing she mentioned was noticing the stock in the fields was nice as there were only a few still last year. Talking over things is still hard sometimes although it seems a long time ago the feelings and emotions are still deep. Certain parts can still hit a
 
raw nerve. There seems to be a mere anger at the moment generally. People and farmers are wanting to know why they still have restrictions, what is going to happen about shows and sales etc and will normality ever return. Unfortunately I think not, not in
 the way they want it to.

Really good evening at Penrith re the discussion it was so good to talk to the other diarists and realise and be able to relate so closely to what they
 said.  It was poignant to see what other people had written and interesting to see what you had done so far with the data collected, it would be brilliant to hand to any future study or enquiry as it is proof surely not all these people could be wrong!!!
  And to have so many diarists start and finish is amazing.  I\rquote m sure it can be used for so many different topics \endash 
 AMAZING. I am personally very proud to have been a part of it, and although sometimes I have wondered if what I was writing was any use. I ca

t sure who it was, but I just spoke about mainly silly things I can\rquote t really remember what but didn\rquote t get much of a response just yes and no\rquote s and I thought I recognised the voice as being the father we were with today \endash 
 anyway during lunch which we had 
at the farm we were chatting and of  course got into FMD and he thanked me it took aback but he said he had appreciated me waffling on. It was the night of the day his cows had been shot and he had phoned to let us know but he said he just broke down and 
couldn\rquote t say anything \endash  anyway he laughed because he said he was going to hang up, but he couldn\rquote t get word in edgeways because I was wittering but he said he did feel a bit better after. So we had a good heart to heart.

Went milk recording first thing so that was good fun.  After recording I had to collect one of our elderly clients and her dog that was coming for an operation, the lady is 92 and her and the dog are very close so she wanted to stay with her until she was
 sedated. So she was pleased she could come with her.  The girls all laugh at me because I have quite a few little old ladies who we visit and keep a check on their pets.
