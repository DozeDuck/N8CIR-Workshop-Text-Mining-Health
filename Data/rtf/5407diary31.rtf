\par Wednesday- Post FMD meeting in village hall
\par Still waiting for DEFRA to come and check farm electrics and put }{\i\insrsid14419118 (milking)}{\insrsid14419118  parlour back together. Rang them again and again \endash  same old answer \endash  you are on the list.
\par A friend rang, they have recently been re-stocked and their first calf had been born that day. The whole family were out with the camera to photograph their first in their new herd. Pleased to hear that they now feel they are going forward.
\par Went to village hall meeting entitled \'93spring forward\'94 various speakers there including two from Radio Cumbria. Enjoyed the \'93crack\'94, bought the book \'93Heart and Soul\'94 from Radio Cum
bria. Read a few chapters before bedtime, difficult to put it down but eventually went to bed, could not sleep. All those F&M memories came flooding back. Very busy week at work. Farmers trying to get stock moved from farm to farm and wondering when aucti
on marts will begin again.
\par Helped mart manager to complete licence application for mart to begin again. Many questions seemed trivial \endash  do DEFRA use common sense at all?
\par Some land sold by public auction made an average of \'a34000 per acre, a dairy farm sold also for \'a3
402,000 for 140+ acres. Obviously some optimistic farmers around. Had friends and their children round for lunch at the weekend. Usually when they come we have to say about 4pm we will have to go out to work -  but this time enjoyed their company 
for longer and never had to look at clock. The children wanted to know when we would have animals -  they always liked to look at calves and at neighbours sheep in a nearby field.

 that we can put it together again ourselves, as their teams cannot cope. If we had been told this earlier then the job would have been done and finished now. Rang a lad who works for a milking machine f
irm -  he says he will come on Sunday and give his advice.
\par Auction mart given a licence to re-open next week which is good news. Many new rules and regulations to be enforced  -  but at least we can re-open.
\par Many farmers telephoning to ask what regulations are.

A very emotional week, especially on Tuesday. Went to bed Monday night but could not sleep. Up at 4a.m. washed hair, had bath, did housework, anything to fill time in until it was 7 a.m.
\par Went to auction mart for re-starting live sales. Saw many people whom I have not seen for 12 months. Very good to see and chat to them, but when some asked \'93Did your stock survive?\'94
 then memories all came flooding back. Worried that computer equipment in the sale ring would not work -  but everything went very smoothly. Loads of farmers at the mart \endash 
 a real buzz round the rings. Good to get customers back travelling from County Durham, Northumberland and Cumbria.
\par Auctioneers very pleased with the numbers attending. Many farmers questioning the need for all the disinfectant buckets etc but we tell them to use them please.
\par Started with a cold during the week so decided to go to bed early for a couple of nights to get rid of it.
\par Half term holidays from school so daughter helping with meals and housework.
\par Lad here to advise on milking parlour re-instatement, made progress and got machinery running and all new rubber pipes and fittings replaced.
\par Snowed heavily on Friday night. Had to go with Land Rover to collect daughter from her weekend job in local hotel. Pleased that it was my Saturday off work \endash 
 but not much more snow fallen overnight. Cold now much better -  work colleague off on Friday with cold. I suspect I may be guilty of passing it on to him.

where we are getting new herd from. Their silage supplies are running down and when will we want the cows? Rang DEFRA and they say they will send the re-stocking officer (again) to check progress. Still waiting for DEFRA to send electricians. Explained th
is to re-stocking officer and he seemed genuine and said he would see what he could do. Switch on bulk tank seems to be faulty -  sent for repair man -  says it has be }{\i\insrsid14419118 (sic) }{\insrsid14419118 
corroded by disinfectant -  asked him to fit new one and check others.
\par Very worryin
g item on National news. A suspect case of FMD in North Yorks, TV says in pigs but radio says in sheep, movement restrictions put in place around that farm for 5 mile radius. Have we learned any lessons from outbreak? Should we not have had a national mov
ement ban \endash 
 I would have thought so. Will we get the herd from Cheshire? More wondering and worry. TV news says the suspect animals are sheep, and not pigs, as they reported last night. Initial reports seem to suggest that it will not be confirmed -  but th
ey are waiting for blood results.
\par Re-stocking officer comes and checks paperwork. We are told we now need ear numbers of all cattle that we are buying. Rang the owners and asked them to send them, as soon as possible.
\par At least we have positive steps being taken. Provisionally booked lorries to transport the cattle. DEFRA re-stocking officer thinks the application could be processed in 4 or 5 days. Let\rquote s wait and see!

ecided to get milk tank engineers ourselves to get bulk tank checked over-make sure it is working properly some of the switches have been corroded by disinfectant and need replaced. Rang haulage company -  they can bring cattle tomorrow. Went to bed 
\endash  but could not sleep

 they will be sending someone to supervise unloading. Everyone arrives at 3pm \endash 
 still very wet & windy. Cattle seem to have travelled well. Gave them silage and a rest before milking time. Got them into parlour to milk, not bad to get them in. They are not keen on the dairy cake, but will get used to the new taste. 
\par Bath and bed, legs aching, must be all that running around tonight!!
\par Thur: Could not sleep so decided to get up at 4.00am and get milked.
\par Got the first cows into the parlour and machine switched on. Got clusters onto three cows then the machine ground to a halt!
 Wondered how early in the morning you can phone engineer, waited for about half an hour and looked to see if there was anything obvious that was not working. Rang engineer \endash  mobile phone rings and rings \endash 
 no-one answers. Rang the land line & his mother answers and says he is on holiday and staying locally, so she will phone him.
\par He arrives at 6.30am & makes temporary repair. Got them all milked and have breakfast. Engineer back to make proper repair. Evening milking much more straightforward. Bed early that night.
\par Fri: Cows settling in well and some now coming into the parlour voluntarily.
\par Milk tanker here to collect milk today. Got milk ticket for the F&M photograph album and will send photographs of cows arriving to be developed.

as I have been invited to judge 2 sections of beef cattle at the show. They have a new location for the show this year, a field on the other side of the town. There are cattle, horses, dogs etc at the show but due to regulations no sheep. Have coffee with
 
my steward for the event and then we make our way into the judging ring. Cattle areas are fenced around and everyone has to walk over disinfectant mat. General public are admitted into cattle lines without restriction. Steward asks me if I will want to to
uch the cattle. I reply that it is possible. I am then given a pair of disposable gloves to wear.\line 
No great numbers of cattle at show but at least it is good to see some there. Judging job does not take very long. Very enjoyable judging them. When job is com
plete the gloves are put into a bag and taken away by a committee member. Interesting to note that whilst walking through cattle lines that members of the public, in particular townsfolk, are touching the cattle and stroking them and no disposal gloves in
 sight!! Had lunch there and saw many farmers that I have not seen the 18 months. And very enjoyable day out catching up with folks.

Day off work on Saturday. Dad wants me to drive him to dispersal sale of cattle on a farm in Humberside. I agree to go. Have a look on computer at night to check the mileage and

Phone call at night to say another couple are going to sale and we will all go together. Arranged to meet them

Grass lettings for summer season also held this week. Much more demand than last year. Averages must be around \'a390 per acre mark - obviously everyone must have more stock about and need the acres for 
their IACS returns in order to claim the subsidy payments.
\par Had a move round of cattle and calves. Some heifers getting nearer to calving so got them into top shed. AGA fixed on the Friday - good.\line Saturday - husband, daughter and schoolfriend off to Cardiff
 for football match tomorrow. It is finals of LDV trophy and Carlisle are competing. Made them packed lunches and they were off at 10:30am. They are staying with relations near Cardiff tonight. Home alone for me - but plenty of work to keep me busy.\line 
Dad and I it went out for Sunday lunch - nice change. Home and listened football commentary on Radio. Carlisle seemed to be playing well but not scoring any goals. The other team scores about 10 minutes from finish and it is all over for Carlisle.
\par Family arrive home at 10.15 - tired but had a good trip.
\par 
\par Week 62
\par Some early starts this week - we have sales on six days this week. Up early to get farm work done before starting at Auction mart. Contractor here to plough 2 fields. Another dry week with frosty nights f
orecast. Tuesday was the Easter show and sale of both prime cattle and sheep. A very good show of quality cattle with champion making 150 p per kilogram. Cow calved twins at night - late milking and very late supper!! A big store sale on Thursday. sowed w
heat and grass seeds on fields on Friday.  On-farm sale of machinery and cattle near Silloth on Saturday. Owners are retiring and it has been bought by neighbours. Spring work on farm being done - fields rolled, grass harrowing and fertiliser sown.
\par 
\par Week 63
\par More spring work to be done on the farm this week as the weather still good but forecast says it is to change later in week.\line 
Sowed grass seeds, harrowed them in and then rolled field. Went to help friend with her computer at night. This is Easter holidays from school this week. Been felling a hedge (or dyke as we call it in Cumbria) finished cleaning it out and started to lie.
\line Went for load of posts ready for fencing as it is Easter weekend and two bank holidays - so thought sawmill would be closed. A long
 weekend off from work at auction. Friend and her two children came for the day on the Friday to make the traditional pasche eggs. They turned out very well. Let the cows out during the day - so it was a "Good Friday". Not that much grass but they were ha
p
py to go out and we are still offering same amount of silage to eat. Went to the office on Saturday morning to make a catalogue for the next store cattle sale. Made the deadline of posting it out by 12 noon as no postal collection or delivery on Monday. M
ade a Turkey dinner for Easter which went down very well. Cows still housed at nights but lovely to see them out during the days.

Another holiday week from school. Difficult to know what day it is due to routine changed and day of week. Easter Monday brought rain - but not as much as forecast. Neighbour called and asked me to type a letter for h
er - having some problem with DEFRA. Spent a bit of the day baking as we are invited to a birthday party tonight. Got finished milking at night when there was a thunderstorm rain and lightning. Electric went off but back on in a couple of minutes. Enjoyed
 
the night at the party. Rest of the weekend was normal. Went out for supper on Friday night as a "back to school/end of holidays" treat. Went to visit a neighbour who has just had a baby daughter. Heifer calved in afternoon. Went for a ride around Keswick
 area after supper before it got dark. Finished fence this week and burned thorns.
\par Had a busy week at work with OTM scheme. The price is to be cut by 20 percent for OTM cattle so there was a rush to get rid of cows before the drop. Thankfully we were able to increase our allocation and get them all away that were booked in.
\par 
\par Week 65
\par Daughter back to school this week. Started the week with a furniture sale. Nothing really exciting there, just straightforward. Tuesday was an important day - husband is a footba
ll fan and Carlisle are playing for League survival at a match at Shrewsbury. He travelled down with a group of friends to spectate match. We listened commentary on Radio and are pleased to say they won, so the car ffull of fans came home very happy. Atte
nded a YFC stock-judging the next night. Helped to train the members in the art of judging dairy cows.\line 
A much quieter morning with the OTM cattle since the price was cut earlier in the week. Had a phone call to say a friend has lost her mother today - must call and visit her on Friday.
\par A former work colleague phoned tonight. I have not spoken to her for ages - so it was good to catch up. Cows still out only through the day. They are still eating the same amount a silage but milk quantity has risen. Had a let
ter to say we will be TB testing in a fortnight - will keep heifers in until the testing is over - making it easier, so booked a week's holiday from work as I will need two days off for TB testing. Here's keeping fingers crossed for the result. There are 
talks of quite a bit of TB about - but in herds that kept their stock as well as those who have restocked.\line Spring lambs are on the market this week. They are very much in demand with the best price of \'a3
103 per head been achieved. Daughter got her exam timetable for the GCSE exams. There are some days she has two and sometimes three exams. She made bread rolls at school today - very tasty.
\par 
\par Week 66
\par Bank holiday on Monday. A lot of rain early morning. Pleased I am not on a camping holiday in the Lake District.
 Had usual sales this week. Completed IACS forms and delivered them to RPA offices. Cleaned out sheds at night. TB testing the whole herd on Friday. Finished at 2:30pm. Electric went off at 3pm. Rang the supplier, told it would be back at 6:00pm - still n
o
t at 6:30pm so rang again. Told that the problem was now much bigger and expected return time was midnight. Got the tractor and generator out and belts changed ready for milking. Got the job done. Electric still off at bedtime. Woke up at 1.50 am and elec
tric came back gone. 
\par Busy with YFC activities at the weekend, preparing for Field Day next weekend.
\par 
\par Week 67
\par Had a week's holiday from work. Spent Monday reading the TB.  Results seemed to be okay. Went to Carlisle with niece to buy her a 21st birthday pre
sent. Went for haircut on Tuesday morning. Got home and phone rang. It was RPA/BCMS saying that that within one hour they would be on farm to do a whole herd inspection of cattle and their paperwork. Got all the paperwork out and covered kitchen table. In
s
pectors arrived and began their work, left at milking time. Will ring to  say when they are coming to complete the job. Had phone-call from work to say a lot of cattle entered for the Thursday sale and I am needed. Up very early that day. In the evening w
ent to a presentation of awards night at Reghed for Pentalk computers. Very pleased to see that one from my area won a county award as well as the smaller regional awards.\line 
Went for haircut the next morning. Went to 21st birthday party of my niece at night. 
Up very early next morning. Husband off to Cardiff to watch FA Cup final. Daughter and I to YFC Field Day. She was competing and finished First for stock-judging in Holsteins and Third in "Ready  Steady Cook" competition. Home to milk. Husband home 10:30p
m. Took daughter and schoolfriend to dance at night. Friends' parents bringing them home - so went to bed.
\par 
\par Week 68
\par Daughter on GCSE exams for the next two weeks. Three inspectors arrive from BCMS/RPA. Put all cattle through t
he crush to read all ear tags. I wish they would communicate with veterinary officers. This job could have been done the same day as TB testing. When I suggested this the answer given was "we are a different department\'94
. Read more ear tags while on holiday than I do while at work!!\line 
Tuesday back to work and back to normal, and similar day on Wednesday and Thursday.  on Saturday went to work to make catalogue for store cattle sale and post out - bank holiday on Monday so no postal service. Turned some heifers
 out at the weekend. Doing accounts and VAT in spare time.
\par 
\par Week 69
\par Holidays this week. Cleaned out front of silage pit ready for filling with first cut. Weather much improved. In fact better than the forecast. Contractor for silage going full steam ahead.
 Seems to be able to pick up a lot of grass in a day. Had store cattle sale on Thursday but smaller entry due to silage weather. At night got phone call to say that mowing would start on Friday. Spent Friday evening baking for silage makers. Up early on S
a
turday. Contractor here to row up grass ready to pick up at 9 am. Conditions very favourable. Sun and wind. Neighbours here to lead trailers of grass. Opened birthday cards and gifts. Last load grass coming in at 4pm. The job had been completed in record 
time. Rolled the pit at night. Rolled the pit on Sunday morning and then sheeted it. Put tyres on and some straw. It's Dad's birthday today so we took him to a local restaurant for supper - nice meal.
\par 
\par Week 70
\par A load of straw to put on silage pit. Turned so
me cattle out at night. Cows laid out tonight (2nd June) as we cannot get any silage out of pit yet. Went for another load of straw to finish covering first cut pit. Pressure washing sheds in spare time. Got them clean to my standard (not DEFRA) as last y
ear. Went to lead silage for neighbour at teatime and again next day. Planted hanging baskets and tubs in yard. Went to stock-judging at night - good do. It was at a farm that missed FMD - despite being surrounded by it.
\par Daughter's birthday on Sunday. Made her choice of menu for lunch and friends came round with cards and presents - not much cake left by bedtime!! Not much revising done today.\line 
Had a visit from a farmer looking to buy heifers with calves at foot. Had a look at ours. He will think about it (and the price tag!)

 Pressure washing last of old silage pit. Went to neighbours to clip cattle he's going to sell later in the week. Discussed with him that we felt there are a lot of buttercups in fields this year. Wondered if it was due to F and 
M and fields lacking management in 2001 and it has taken time to come through. It must be - we cannot come up with any alternative explanation. GCSE exams finished on Thursday. I will not need to say the word "revise" for some considerable time. Husband a
way to lead silage for neighbour - weather still ideal.

Chap phoned to say he wanted to buy all our heifers and calves and will send wagon for them on Friday. Good news!! Spread muck on to silage fields - need to get the next crop growing!! Went out for ba
r meal at night. Belated birthday treat for daughter and celebration that exams are all finished.
