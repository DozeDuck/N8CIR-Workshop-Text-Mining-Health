\par 
\par Tuesday was a bit traumatic for me because 2 years ago I had a major operation \endash  the removal of a kidney which contained a large cancerous tumour.  I was extremely lucky and needed no more treatment as the tumour was contained within the
 kidney.  It was a shock and pretty scary!  I had to go to the hospital for a scan on my remaining kidney and other internal organs \endash  I go once a year \endash 
 as a routine check.  Everything was OK.  So I went back to work in a better frame of mind.
\par Went swimming tonight with my eldest son }{\fs24\insrsid6767504  }{\fs24\insrsid78443 and B.  We hire a private pool on a Tuesday nights, B}{\fs24\insrsid6767504  }{\fs24\insrsid78443
