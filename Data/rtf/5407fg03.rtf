\par F, M, 
\par 
\par }{\f0\insrsid2693984 L.\tab We thought it was far enough away,
\par 
\par J.  \tab Long way away and then all of a sudden Longtown.  Then you could see the smoke from the Aspatria along the coastline and very quickly\'85
\par 
\par L.\tab Alan and I agreed, we laid 5 of our staff off on 14}{\f0\super\insrsid2693984 th}{\f0\insrsid2693984  March and said in 14 days we will be back working.  They all remember that, we have a good laugh about that because 9 months later we weren
\rquote t working.
\par 
\par J.  \tab We send about 600 statements a month out and 200 of those are non-event statements like garages and fuel dumps.  So that is about 400 genuine customers and our chairman was one of the first to get it in our area and after about 3 or 4 days I hadn
\rquote t had any contact he rang up and said are you doing anything about the people who have got foot and mouth.  I said what do you mean.  He said are you writing somebody, or ringing them.  Well I haven\rquote 
t thought about it.  He said I have had people ring me (inaudible) who I don\rquote t know, who I have never spoken to, ring me an
d say how sorry they were that we had got it.  Because they are quite a well-known family I suppose.   So then I said well, yes so I sat down and devised a letter which was sent out to everybody who had got it, people who we were on first name terms with.
  And again we were on finally  340 out of 400 and that didn\rquote t take the contiguous one out.  Those were people who actually had Foot and Mouth.  That is how disastrous it was for us.   I mean just one disaster after another really.
\par 
\par BM.   As you say about those that are the contiguous ones.  The ones that actually got it they knew they had they knew they had it, they knew they had to loose it and everybody I found that I talked to were living in fear.  It was the fear in people
\rquote s mind.  When is it  us.  I mean you sort of looked at the list every day and was people who you knew and was it near you.  As the contiguous went out, I mean their animals hadn\rquote 
t got it, as far as they knew, and they were having to loose the stock and it was really hard for them.  
\par 
\par J.\tab The biggest pressure was that people looked to you for sympathy and you were telling the same story 20/30/40 times a day.  You were going home and you were actually shell shocked. 
\par 
\par L.\tab You were.
\par 
\par J.\tab You were going home and the wife would say you are quiet \endash  well I have done nothing but talk all day.  It is the same story, people are saying how is it spreading, how does it get here, how did it get there, why did I get, why didn\rquote 
t he get it.
\par 
\par L.\tab Because they were isolated and they needed someone to talk to.
\par 
\par M.\tab Yes.  
\par 
\par L.\tab They were on the phone for hours.
\par 
\par D.\tab  It wasn\rquote t if we get it, it was when we get it.
\par 
\par L.\tab Yes, people\rquote s emotions, I had grown men crying, and I used to phone every customer that we had when they got foot and mouth.  I stopped doing it becau
se it was affecting me and I wrote them a letter, a little note similar to you, and the appreciation of that was wonderful.
\par 
\par D.\tab One of the first farms that went down at Longtown, Fishers, Robin phoned me on the Sunday, and it was just somebody to talk to.
\par 
\par L.\tab Yes, that was how they were.
\par 
\par D.\tab The thing that bothered Robin was his stock was still lying.
\par 
\par L.\tab And they were scared for their neighbours.
\par 
\par D.\tab It wasn\rquote t so much that, it was the kids.  The kids in the house.  They wouldn\rquote t deliver oil to his farm and
 there was no heating in the house for the kids.  We persuaded them in the finish, between us, to fetch it in barrels and roll it down planks over the mat so he could get oil for the heating for the kids.  He was in a hell of a...
\par 
\par L.\tab I think at the beginn
ing neighbours were good, especially in villages.  Everybody took food to farms.  You could see it outside farms there were little packages, presents and flowers and as it escalated and it got more I suppose that was lost, but at the beginning....
\par 
\par D.\tab Ther
e was a mate of mine went down.  He was late on and his neighbour down the road got foot and mouth and then it was ten days after he did and when he eventually walked down the lane there was a bottle of vodka and a little note down the lane for him.

\par B.\tab When I first heard about foot and mouth I was actually in the auction mart and this fellow came in and said there is foot and mouth in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}Essex{\*\xmlclose}
.  And you thought God that is in this country.  The next day you heard it in
 Northumberland and you thought that is the next county.   The day after that it was Longtown, but it was still a long way from Wigton.  And it was certainly a long way from Ireby where I live.  
\par Then the auction mart stopped trading from then on so I wasn\rquote 
t at the market again and when we got up in the morning I used to say to my husband what day is it?  He would say how do you not know what day it is?  Because my daily routine then was gone, because he was working in the market Tuesdays and Thursdays and 
from then on I didn\rquote t know what day it was.  I have to be quite honest.  His reaction was how could you not know what day it is but I got used with that not going anywhere or anything.  
\par We got up in the morning I used to do the dairy cattle, he did round the beef and young stock and our first thing in the morning was we each looked round our bit.  If I didn\rquote 
t go to look for him it meant I had found nothing that looked ill or anything that was suspicious at all.  The day we actually did find it, in some ways it was a relief because we didn\rquote 
t have to look, we knew.  It was an awful feeling I cannot describe to anybody what we felt like.  But some of the worries and tension was taken away then because that is it, we have got it and that is it.  
\par I must say, following on from what everybody else has said, we have received over 100 letters and cards from people.  Some from people we didn\rquote 
t know.  But I must say with working at the auction mart we did know a lot of people.  Our front doorstep is on the roadside, o
ne of my neighbours rung me up one day and she said there is a queer big box of groceries on your front doorstep.  Because I had never been out of the house I didn\rquote 
t know that they were there even.  We received all sorts of things that were just left at the doorstep \endash  groceries, flowers, you name it.  Without the support of your friends and your family and people that you didn\rquote t know \endash 
 it was overwhelming, I would have to say.

\par We were persuaded by one of my relations to stop and have something to eat on the way home.  I never enjoyed the meal at all, I have got to admit, because we felt as if we shouldn\rquote t have been there.  We would have been happier staying at home.

I gave her a hug and I said you will be glad that you have got off, and they said no.  They felt dirty.

t want to move either because obviously we went to farm to farm and the fuel yard as well.  The last thing that we wanted to think, all the way through it, the last thing that you wanted was to anybody to think that the
re was a chance that you might have taken it from somewhere else.    Well you couldn\rquote 
t go to farms that had been infected anyway but not everybody knew that at the start in particular.  That is how it affected us most at the start because we were sat at ho
me.  It gave us the chance to get other things done.  I think like quite a few of the people have said as well that anybody you talked to in a lot of cases it was a relief for them when they actually got it.  Because they were sitting on tenterhooks for s
o long wondering when it was going to be them when it actually came they knew, well that is it, it is all over know there is nothing more we can do.  We will just have to accept what happens and that is it.  At least you are not sitting there.

 stopped we were stopped 3 week in that 3 weeks the phone calls we had, accused of fetching foot and mouth back into the county and to different places because of the wagons travelling the distance they were travelling, the amount of stock that we shi

  I mean look beside Hallburn.  There is 4 farms on Hall burn still have got their stock and the amount of foot and mouth that went in and out of there.
\par 
\par AF.\tab Four farms, my neighbours at home and all that traffic was going into Hallburn with the dead stock on and those farms are still there and they didn\rquote t have any problems.  And all those animals went passed that gate.  In
 fact J, them  next door to us the fields are higher than the road and the cattle were reaching over the hedges and they could just about touch the  trucks sometimes as they went past.
\par 
\par D.\tab It was the same when they done the culling of the sheep in\'85 Our lad

\par 
\par }{\b\f0\insrsid2693984 What was the first thing you remember about it?
\par 
\par }{\f0\insrsid2693984 R.\tab The first thing I remember is when it was confirmed in Northumberland.  Immediately my first thought being it being amongst the farms and whatever and remembering the 67 outbreak in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Cheshire{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. I was in general haulage at the time.  I remem
ber that well because we went through hell going down there.  My first thought was where do we get disinfectant from even though it had just started in Northumberland and then it just escalated from there.  Obviously, each driver was saying have I got a j
ob left, what is going to happen.  Well fortunately or unfortunately I don\rquote 
t know which way you need look at it you are going to look at it.  As we had to increase disinfectant as we were going around farms it was taking them longer to pick milk up so inste
ad of them picking up 3 loads a day, some where picking up 2 loads.  Some where picking 1 load up and it just ... you dreaded the phone ringing.
\par 
\par }{\b\f0\insrsid2693984 MM. \tab What would the phone ringing....
\par 
\par }{\f0\insrsid2693984 R.\tab Well, 9 out 10 times it was someone who had been confirmed with foot and mouth or was suspected.  We hadn\rquote 
t to got on the farm and as others have said you shed tears along with them some of them, especially if they were family friends you had known for years.
\par 
\par D.\tab That\rquote s what a lot of it is, I mean everybody, anything to do with agriculture, everybody is connected.  It is not just customers, it is family, friends, everybody knows everybody.
\par 
\par R.\tab I mean you would be ready to go home at night thinking it has been a hell of a day but let\rquote s get away home.  The phone would ring yo
u had to immediately start to change, not one route round but half a dozen routes round, which you must agree.  Just to accommodate it, to put farms on that were in infected areas and clean farms.  I am pleased that there is somebody in here that realises
 how difficult the transport side of it was.  
\par 
\par D.\tab Well we ended up putting the lads that were on the livestock wagon to start with we put them on as second man on the milk tankers.  Because they were stopping at every farm disinfecting in and out and then 
if it was a close contact it had to be the last pick up on its own.  Our lad weren\rquote t finished they just couldn\rquote 
t keep up with it.  You were just lossing your milk all the time it was getting busier because it was taking longer to do it.  So we ended up putting two men on every wagon to try to keep up with it.
\par  
\par R.\tab And even though you were in the office doing the office work and sort of supervising things I think you went home more shattered than what the drivers actually did.  Because you weren\rquote t resting wh
en you got home because you were getting phone calls through night saying don\rquote t go and pick so so up.

\par 
\par A.\tab The first valuation that I did which was in the Penrith area, I actually knew the Ministry vet who was appointed to that farm, I knew him socially because he played rugby.  After we had completed the va

\rquote t happen this disease is going to go right through this county.  I said no you cannot be serious.  He said I am telling you the truth.  On that particular farm the farmer first saw a problem on the Wednesday, they weren\rquote 
t slaughtered until the following Tuesday morning and the bodies lay another 8 days in the yard.  That is why this disease spread through this county.  
\par 
\par J.\tab The difference in 1967 is that there was a different method of disposal.  They got a big digger in.  They dug a pit, filled it with lime, put the cows in, end of story, that was the day.  Those environmental people wouldn\rquote 
t let them bury them.  That was the big problem.  I would bury them.

wrong with the cows and they reported it.  By milking time in the afternoon, everything was slaughtered and the digger was in and when he went out he just went up actually at milking time next morning and they were covered over, gone.
\par 
\par AF.\tab The big difference this time was because the problem was the numbers. every farmer had 3 times the stock as he did have in 1967 at least and some have got more.  I mean you can\rquote

 then within a few hours and thank goodness there  is, is it Fiona Armstrong, of Northern News because it is only through her definitely because she really quizzed him on it and he backtracked and said it was misunderstood.  But I don\rquote

\par L.\tab I think your allegiance has changed as well.  You did feel sorry for people who had got foot and mouth and had gone down with it and especially at the beginning.  They were the worst
 ones, at the very beginning.  But as time went by you felt sorry for the ones who were struggling to survive.
\par 
\par AF.\tab It is the beef and sheep farmers who suffered the most.
\par 
\par L.\tab Yes, they were really struggling.  As you said families - I have heard of lots of cases of families even them telling me themselves who have fallen out because farmers are there own worse enemy that they can\rquote 
t help but brag.  And some farmers have gone bragging about how much money they have got and singing in pubs or they have had ne

\par

\par

herefore it was sitting there making them nothing because they couldn\rquote t put it into a long term investment.  So they were no better off then the ones in a sense that hadn\rquote t got foot and mouth except they hadn\rquote t had the same hardship.

\par 
\par L.\tab We aren\rquote t disputing the fact that they got compensation it is the fact that what their attitude to it and how they expressed that attitude to other people who were still struggling.

t really need the money, I didn\rquote t want the money, if I had the choice, I would rather have the sheep, and there are an awful lot of farmers who have said that.
