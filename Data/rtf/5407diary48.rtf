300. The ones who lost ca
ttle grew more grains. We requested more straw when prices cheaper but the dealer would not bring it at that time, considering haulage costs should have decreased I cannot understand this increase but we need this straw all winter. We have used this straw
 
dealer for a few years but the next load of straw we will be comparing more prices! Brought washing in as forecast bad, then I went to school to work, by lunch it was raining and dark afternoon. School post has details of next school inspection, Head gett

I read in my Annandale Newspaper there was a European Parliament Committee on FMD public meeting at Gretna, and decided I should make the effort to go. When I arrived I tried to find a seat in a quiet corner, many of the seats 
were reserved for the delegates.
\par }\pard\plain \s22\qj \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \f1\fs20\lang2057\langfe2057\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp2057 {\i\f0\fs24\insrsid4136305 
The Chairman did not speak English but the interpreters were helpful. Unfortunately, I found that I was sat next to a very rude man who continually disrupted the meeting, heckling and interrupting which was totally uncalled
 for. I had difficulty hearing the names of speakers because of him. It\rquote s a pity the Chairman did not eject him but they must think this is normal British behaviour! Because of this I think the meeting could be described as a shambles.
\par Russell Brown the MP
 for the area spoke but was continually interrupted, he tried to put the heckler in his place but to no avail. The MP did point out that the farmers who were left with stock had a great struggle. I was grateful to him for saying this. We had a monthly mil
k cheque to help us, but farmers who do not milk had a very difficult time, which is often ignored. A French panel member later asked if reports were true that animals had not been fed during the outbreak.
\par Dr Elaine Murray MEP spoke and was interrupted. The
 rude man continued this behaviour while Robin Spence a Lockerbie farmer tried to speak. Mr Spence said he hoped that allowing his animals to be culled had helped to stop the disease. A Scottish farmer took offence at this and shouted. But I agree with Mr
 Spence that at the time we were being told that a \'93firebreak\'94
 would stop the spread of infection. On hindsight I wonder whether firebreaks made any difference and why certain farms survived in the middle of infected areas. I also remember seeing Robin Spen
ce upset, on TV at the time and know he did not take the disease lightly.
\par Andrew Campbell, the Convener of Dumfries and Galloway Council spoke of setting up the \'93bunker\'94 control centre. A local vet, Roger Windsor spoke, he told of his experience of FMD abroad and of cutbacks in Ministry Veterinary Service.
\par The speaker who impressed me most was a journalist and animal health businessman, Mr Jobson. He spoke of most of the problems of FMD and even brought tears to my eyes. Unfortunately the chairman did not allow him enough time.
\par Individual panel members spoke and vaccination kept being mentioned. It was suggested that rules should be drawn up jointly with EU countries to combat FMD in future, I hope something sensible is done. Ireland, Holland etc brought the
 disease under control much faster than Britain, and a lot less animals sacrificed. I do wonder why the Penrith Spur went on so long, especially after we should have learned lessons in the previous months.
\par Meanwhile, the rude man had put his name down to speak so we had to listen to him. A lot of what he said was not true, eg that the first case in Cumbria was near Penrith! Two more Cum}{\i\f0\fs24\insrsid5055406 Farm worker}{\i\f0\fs24\insrsid4136305 
s had come from with him, they were not good speakers. Other members of the audience spoke; a lady became very e
motional about how they had taken her pet sheep; another who runs an animal sanctuary had fought to keep her animals, I am glad she succeeded. Stewartry farmer Robert Graham made an excellent speech and said we must learn by the mistakes and never let it 
happen again.
\par At the end of the meeting I could keep quiet no longer and gave the rude man a piece of my mind. I tried but I don\rquote t think I succeeded to quieten this man, but then neither did any of the other speakers at the meeting!

s forecast for week reckoned rain this week. It appears we have a lot to learn about dealing with contractors, we should have been tormenting him to get him here. We thought he would remember! We are now going to phone everyday, if we had done that la
st week he would have been here at the correct time. Back to school after holiday busy as usual. Walked }{\fs24\insrsid3566269 [dog]}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  down field.
\par Tuesday Dry nice day. Hosed but no calves to feed as they have been shifted. Had to go to dentist for emergency as my new tooth crown 
had fallen out, thank goodness it was bottom tooth. Quick shop in Annan then back to Gretna to decorate. Weather getting duller, phoned contractor. Walked }{\fs24\insrsid3566269 [dog]}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  down field.
\par Wednesday. Nice day not so warm. Hosed parlour then hosed roadside where silage will be dumped. Contractor arrived late afternoon to cut silage and was not very popular as getting very dull, he didn\rquote t get much cut when torrential rain arrived so }{
\fs24\insrsid5055406 Husband}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  stopped him cutting as they do not know when the chopper will be here. Walked }{\fs24\insrsid3566269 [dog]}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  down field.
\par Thursday. Dull, hosed parlour. Thank you letter in post for wedding present, funny thing is that I have still got present here, but it is all to do with internet, the couple know what they are getting in advance. Worked at school for a couple of
 hours.  Walked }{\fs24\insrsid3566269 [dog]}{\fs24\insrsid4136305 
 . Contractor here to cut more silage but still no word when chopper will be here. It arrived after 7, we told them we could have had silage in  ourselves by now. They are not popular at coming when rain starts. They got rained off at midnight.
\par Friday 6}{\fs24\super\insrsid4136305 th}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  June Windy and showers. Hosed parlour. Busy at school. Weather improved after lunch, chopper started silaging after 3pm, rained off again at 8.30 pm. Collected papers, had quick read. Walked }
{\fs24\insrsid3566269 [dog]}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  later.
\par Saturday 7}{\fs24\super\insrsid4136305 th}{\fs24\insrsid4136305 . Sunny and windy, 
grass rather wet. Hosed. Contractor started silage after 2pm and finished 8pm. All first in shed, probably a week late! The contractor certainly can do the job much quicker then the machines }{\fs24\insrsid5055406 Husband}{\fs24\insrsid4136305 
 has here but their time in coming was far too late. There
 was another contractor in the district at the right time so obviously we had booked the wrong contractor, we are learning fast. The contractor we used has been here spreading slurry and ploughing and has been reliable for those jobs but obviously he has 
booked too many silage jobs for the same day, we must watch more carefully for second cut. Contractor\rquote s wife and their 2 children dropped in to visit. Walked }{\fs24\insrsid3566269 [dog]}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  after they left.
\par Sunday. Damp morning, that will help the grass to grow. Hosed parlour. Tidie
d road a bit silage everywhere, strange I saw lads with brushes yesterday and I thought this is too good to be true. I cannot understand what they were doing with the brushes! Rain after lunch so I powerhosed the mess on the roadside. Rain got heavier as 
afternoon went on. Walked }{\fs24\insrsid3566269 [dog]}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  in field. Took wedding present up to Lockerbie, had lovely evening with D, }{\fs24\insrsid8589011 N}{\fs24\insrsid4136305  and S}{\fs24\insrsid6690191  }{\fs24\insrsid4136305
