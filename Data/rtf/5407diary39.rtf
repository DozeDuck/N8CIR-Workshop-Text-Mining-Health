\par We moved the llamas to our back yard last Friday after easily obtaining a movement license from DEFRA (they have nothing to do now - we had the licence back within a day!). The llamas loo
k raggedy and unkempt but are healthy. It has rained for a week straight so they have spent most of their time pooping in the barn. Other than worrying about how much poop I have to clean up, I didn\rquote 
t do anything except watch TV and play on the internet.
\par 
\par This is the 2}{\super\insrsid13578975 nd}{\insrsid13578975  time I\rquote ve been sick in 2 months! Very unusual. I think I\rquote m a bit susceptible at the minute because I\rquote 
m worried about B & B bookings not coming in like they should (for the summer) and also I\rquote m still worried and stressed about the possibility of not being able to resume trekking. More when I feel better\'85..
\par 
\par }{\b\insrsid13578975 Week 2
\par }{\insrsid13578975 Lazed around on Monday but feeling better. Still coughing and spluttering and generally tired. Actually got out to the movies by myself to see \lquote Rat Race\rquote . I love the movies! Went to the Metrocentre but couldn\rquote 
t spend }{\ul\insrsid13578975 any}{\insrsid13578975  money. We\rquote re broke this week.
\par 
\par Interview with I}{\insrsid7014348  }{\insrsid13578975 brought back some FMD tension and I actually dreamed about the llamas again (that night) - they weren\rquote t being killed this time but I recall being told (by who??) that they can never move again.
\'94 In reality, one of the llamas made a dash for freedom when the gate was open to let my husband in  - he pranced around the front garden for 5 minutes until we chased him back in. God knows how many neighbours witnessed that! I sp
ent 2 days shovelling poop out of the barn - hard to find }{\ul\insrsid13578975 any}{\insrsid13578975  help. Every teenager who\rquote s willing is either a \lquote criminal\rquote  or doesn\rquote t show up when expected. My back hurts!
\par 
\par As long as I\rquote m kept busy my brain doesn\rquote t \lquote wander\rquote  to out predicament. We still know NOTHING about the new movement laws. We got some guests in on Thursday for a couple of days. I let them see the llamas from the back door and 
}{\insrsid16594567 [llama]}{\insrsid13578975  spit on the husband. He has gotten bad tempered during all this confinement. Fortunately, people usually think it\rquote s funny. I gave them a small discount for \lquote laundry.\rquote 
\par 
\par My friends }{\insrsid10694295 Labradors}{\insrsid13578975  were dropped off on Saturday for \lquote baby sitting\rquote  I get \'a320/day for this so no problem! Overall this week my health was still lousy but I managed to get a lot of work done. I s
till feel like we are in \lquote limbo\rquote  and when I get \lquote quiet time\rquote  I don\rquote t know what to do with it. I find myself starting 3 or 4 projects at once and then abandoning them in the \lquote To Do\rquote 
 pile. Should I send out a newsletter to try and get business? (half way through it) No, we STILL don\rquote 
t know about the llamas and I would just have to do another within weeks. So when the brain starts racing and things like that get me depressed - I turn the music up loud and find some busy work, i.e. scrub down the kitchen, brush
 the big dog, wash the carpets\'85.
\par 
\par }{\b\insrsid13578975 Week 3
\par }{\insrsid13578975 Monday was dreadfully boring. I got caught up on laundry and my paperwork but my accounting for 2001 is still sitting there in a huge pile. I }{\ul\insrsid13578975 cannot}{\insrsid13578975  get the \lquote gumption\rquote 
 to start it. The accountant will start \lquote barking\rquote  for it soon and }{\ul\insrsid13578975 then}{\insrsid13578975  I\rquote ll be in trouble.
\par 
\par Tuesday again boring. I didn\rquote t sleep well last night. Dreams about guests being here and being difficult (no one has ever been difficult - where does that come from?). Played on the computer most of the day. Get 
some guests in today (Wednesday) for 3 nights. Quiet, little, young, mousey types. No fun! Just turned up out of the blue. Didn\rquote t do much today. Played on the computer (internet).
\par 
\par Thursday - our anniversary - 4 years. After breakfast and clean up - we went bowling! God we had fun just like we used to. Played 5 games and then home for a cuddle (like we used to!). Good day and evening.
\par 
\par Friday - clean, breakfast, blah, blah. Full house tonight (money!). BW - another llama trekker called today to say we could apply for a \lquote licence to trek\rquote  But since DEFRA hasn\rquote 
t decided what the movement laws are going to be - what good is this? Cart before the horse! IDIOTS! Bruce hasn\rquote t been able to trek for 16 months - he has other problems with DEFRA. I am }{\ul\insrsid13578975 so}{\insrsid13578975  sick of this! 
I just turned the music up loud again and cleaned the kitchen.
\par 
\par Saturday - full house again. Busy cleaning }{\ul\insrsid13578975 all day}{\insrsid13578975 , Drank a whole bottle of wine this evening and watched TV.
\par 
\par Sunday - Our collie (who has epilepsy) has 2 seizures in the night - effectively KILLING whatever sleep I was getting. It takes her several hours to recover and so we stroke her for hours - quietly. She\rquote s ok now though. She is our \lquote baby
\rquote  and so nothing is too much trouble. We only have to go through this every 5-6 months, thank goodness. Full house again - breakfast this am was rough, I wanted to go back to bed! More cleaning and laundry then bed at 9pm. Snooze !! zzz

Monday, the Newfoundland presented me with an infected foot this morning. Big boil full of puss. Popped it, clea
ned it out, stuffed it full of antibiotic ointment and started him on antibiotic tablets. Thank God I work fore the vet part-time so I have this stuff around the house. Even though he is insured the excess would still be \'a3
55 for a vet visit, hopefully it won\rquote t come to that. Had two guests in, breakfast, clean up, laundry, then I stuffed my face and watched TV. No energy after 4 o\rquote 
clock or so. Watched the paramount comedy channel for hours and then fell asleep on the sofa. }{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975  will be in Newcastle till Wednesday night.
\par 
\par Tuesday \endash  2 guests in. Breakfast, clean up, laundry. Then C}{\insrsid16594567  }{\insrsid13578975 came over to cut my hair \endash 
 with her Mum who is blind. We popped open two bottles of wine and drank for 2 hours. Cool! Just gossiped and acted silly. Everybody including me seemed happy and silly. Went to bed early and slept really well.
\par 
\par Wednesday \endash  No guests in. }{\insrsid16594567 T}{\insrsid13578975 he builder came down from Newcastle and worked on a few t}{\insrsid16594567 h}{\insrsid13578975 ings. C}{\insrsid16594567  }{\insrsid13578975

\par 
\par Thursday \endash  2 nice people doing a blacksmiths course locally came to stay for two nights. Really }{\insrsid3370660 nice}{\insrsid13578975  people, I chatted with them for 2 hours! It\rquote 
s nice having people in! I then coloured my hair and went to bed. Boring day.
\par 
\par Friday \endash  Breakfast, cleaning etc. In snowed like crazy but the blacksmith people came and picked up the couple. }{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975  went into Newcastle so I got a lot of work done. 
\par 
\par Sat \endash  }{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975  slept in. I cooked and cleaned then to pub for a few wines, then TV. Boring! No guests in.

 came to stay. They may as well live here! I took all the dogs swimming and got myself soaking wet. The river was way high because of all the rain and snow. Having 5 dogs around the place, plus t
he cats and llamas constantly keeps me busy. Went to pub in the afternoon with }{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975  and met J and E. Drank too much and went to be}{\insrsid16594567 d}{\insrsid13578975  early.

Monday, called my Dad today, he is so depressed since my Mom died 2 years ago. It depresses me to talk to him. No guests in and no hope of any guests all week. The bank account looks slim! Might be a bad week. Today was }{\insrsid16594567 J}{

\par 
\par Thursday, Appointment with solicitors for the big turnover! Plus our birthday. }{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975  got control of his part of the property company. This is GOOD news for us financially. After boring 3 hour paper signing event

This week flew by! Full house every day. But Thursday when I intentionally took the day off, even then all I did was work and shop for food. I hate doing evening meals but they continues to be a demand for them, it means I work from 6am to 9 or 10pm!Plus 
}{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975

 for money for some bills. I can see money arguments on the way.

\par Had a mine expert to take me down to the ballroom on Saturday. I could have taken for people with me, at first everyone wanted to go, but it ended up just being me! Wimps! We went one mile 
in, really interesting experience! I would like to go once more and then that will probably end to my mine experience! I got filthy, and I love getting filthy, big tomboy me.
\par \line I booked a llama trek for July the over the internet, we must have sent 6 e-mail
s back and forth, it's funny how some people will not pick up the phone. Everybody still wants to do the longer treks, but DEFRA or won't allow it. Bruce White in North Yorks keeps telling me about meetings between the BLAA and DEFRA but nothing ever happ

\par Diary 25
\par Sop busy this week I haven\rquote t had time to think about anything except what to do next! If I didn\rquote t write things down in that }{\insrsid3370660 daily}{\insrsid13578975  section I wouldn\rquote 
t be able to remember anything! My memory is shot to hell. I\rquote m way too tired and I can never seem to get enough sleep, on top of my own freaking work I volunteered to help R}{\insrsid7175089  }{\insrsid13578975 and J}{\insrsid7175089  }{
\insrsid13578975 in the pub for dinner time on Saturday (idiot!). I wish I could afford to hire somebody to clean the rooms. I was using somebody last week until I got my last bank statement AHHH! I know I\rquote m broke because of last year \endash 
 we had }{\ul\insrsid13578975 no}{\insrsid13578975  reserves left in the tank plus we borrowed more. I thought at first that this year we would at least break even but even though I\rquote m \lquote full house\rquote  most of the time, I\rquote 
m always into my overdraft. Of course, }{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975  and me separating didn\rquote t help, but I\rquote d rather be broke than
 miserable. He had the gall to make me keep his decorator and wife over for free B&B while he worked on the smithy. He guilted me into it. I am still carrying around a lot of anger about }{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975 
 (why do I write these things right before I go to bed? It just pisses me off and I\rquote ll sleep even worse!). He continues to make me mad in one way or another every time I see him \endash 
 which is way more than I want to. Bed now, wine has kicked in, sleepy.

\par Diary 26
\par Full house every night and I got the 2 }{\insrsid10694295 Labradors}{\insrsid13578975  for more than 2 weeks and my friend }{\insrsid7175089 R}{\insrsid13578975 \rquote 
s dog and her cats and her chickens for a month! Two evening meals and a llama trek. God! I DREAM every night about cooking breakfast and I worry every day about starting the accounting. It\rquote s times like these when I get rea
lly depressed and hate my job, and that\rquote s not right \endash  I LOVE my job, if I could just afford to hire somebody again for just the room cleaning I would be better off, I love being really busy but this is ridiculous, plus it\rquote 
s really boring to do nothing else but cook and clean. I try not to think about bloody FMD but it truly has ruined me for a few years. How will I }{\ul\insrsid13578975 EVER}{\insrsid13578975  get back on top of things?

other words, it's just a matter of time before my brother, sister & I have to come to some decision about what to do with him. It was thanksgiving this Thursday, and of course I forgot about it (how would I be reminded...it doesn't exist here obviously!!)
 
He called and made me feel guilty for not remembering ...and then proceeded to tell me things he's already told me 50 times. Not just normal "forget" stuff but stuff he really should KNOW that he's already told me...about going to doctors and tests and st

ff. God, he's a scary mess and probably should NOT be living alone. This is hard for us kids to really admit "",1 mean, WHO is going to force him to come live with them or put him in assisted living or what-have-you. We keep shoving it to the back of our

A few guests this week, not A LOT of money but it bought me a dinner or two. I have been trying to clean out the freezer of old food that I have lying around. The plan is to get it mostly empty and then defrost it. God! The frost is 1" thick! Only 4 years
 of ice in there! Went to the pub on Thursday night with }{\insrsid16594567 J}{\insrsid13578975 . All she wanted to do was whine and embarrass her husband about the unfortunate affair that he had with }{\insrsid7175089 K}{\insrsid13578975 
. It was mortifying! She is REALLY making him pay for this one! And he is putting on the woun
ded puppy act. It's enough to make you sick. All she is really doing is making everybody think she's an ass (which they did before this event anyway ). Why .can't they keep it at home? WE REALLY don't want to watch her make him grovel! KEEP IT AT HOME! An
yway, to get through the night, I drank about 16gallons of white wine and then suffered like MAD when I had to get up and make breakfast for some Australians that had wandered in for B&B. I also had offered to drive }{\insrsid16594567 J}{\insrsid13578975 
 to work in Alston for the next few days
 and damn near fell asleep on couch just about the time I should've been driving to pick her up. And then as if that night wasn't bad enough, she went back to the pub again on Friday night and got into a major discussion with }{\insrsid7175089 K}{
\insrsid13578975 's husband Ian (he had called her a lying bitch and told her to stop spreading lies about his wife) at which point she told him she could prove that the affair took place by giving him copies of every email that }{\insrsid7175089 K}{
\insrsid13578975  had sent to }{\insrsid7175089 E}{\insrsid13578975 . She then pranced home and made a disk containing some 20
0 emails which she handed over to poor Ian. What is wrong with these people??? I had avoided the pub on Friday, so she called me the next morning to tell me all about it. I called her an ass. A few hours later, }{\insrsid7175089 K}{\insrsid13578975  & I}{
\insrsid7175089  }{\insrsid13578975 came to my front door to ask if they were still going to be caring my little kittens while I'm in Florida and }{\insrsid10694295 I }{\insrsid13578975 said ARE YOU OK? and }{\insrsid7175089 K}{\insrsid13578975 
 said "It will get better" so I am assuming they are working out the problem somehow! I think that pissed off }{\insrsid16594567 J}{\insrsid13578975 , she wants them to be as miserable as she is. SO 
since she really didn't get any satisfaction out of that one she will undoubtedly try something else! This village is soap opera central! SO I'm hung}{\insrsid10694295  }{\insrsid13578975 
over again TODAY though because I took my blind friend Shirley out to the pub. That woman can DRINK! Plus 
she is constantly refilling my glass as well. I had 3 full glasses of wine in front of me at one point I got a bad head today! Do you know it would be very easy to become an alcoholic up here in the hills! There ain't nothing else to do here in Royston Va

 for 3 days. He is still moaning about her peeing on the carpet (she doesn't do that here anymore). I said You have to take her outside and WAIT until she PEES. You can't just lose patience and go back inside! He wants the easy out for everything Yuck}{
\insrsid10694295  }{\insrsid13578975 now that I've mentioned him I feel sick. I really, really just don't like him anymore and I have NEVER gotten the separation that I needed from him.

to, I am now going to take you to court" Well }{\insrsid7175089 J}{\insrsid13578975  and I were due to go to Penrith that minute, so I rang her ",she came over here and stayed with me till }{\insrsid10752677 11 }{\insrsid13578975

that night when he knew I couldn't call my lawyer. The policeman (who was ever so nice and loves Newfoundlands!) said to let him get what he wanted. He disappeared in the back and came out with some crappy shirts he hasn't worn in eons. Later I noticed th

 (who understands this kind of intimidator because his wife had a beaut for a first husband!) come over and change all the lock
s for me and put a bolt on the door that he stole ALL the keys for he can't get in now unless he breaks something. I also had my new lawyer (that I haven't even met yet!) fax him something to keep his body AWAY from the house.

\par BORING week guest}{\insrsid10752677  }{\insrsid13578975 wise. Couple of people in the first half , then dead for 4 days. What that means is that I spend a lot of time cleaning, and THINKING and worrying! And he s
tays over there at the Smithy and spies on me constantly. He won't leave the house! He's completely obsessed and sick in the head if you ask me! The ridiculous thing is I don't DO anything! }{\insrsid10752677 I\rquote }{\insrsid13578975

\insrsid10752677 I\rquote }{\insrsid13578975 ll have to get that sorted out because no money can go in or out of that thing until I change it into my name so that will pile up!

. She is the landlady after all! And yet he constantly tells her things about me or what his solicitor is going to do to me or other stupid crap. She thinks he's a complete wanker ( everyone does) but she maintains a neutral face in fro

\insrsid13843569 [new dog]}{\insrsid13578975  for the past few weeks. What an ass! And it's the dog that's suffering because I'm sure he keeps her locked up a lot and makes his parents 
look after her ...they must LOVE that! Well, I told myself this would happen and so I've detached myself from the dog. I won't let him use the puppy as a tool to get to me. I WON'T!!!!!!!!!

\par The evening meals from hell are over. One night I told them NO be
cause I forgot I had tickets to see Glenn Tilbrook (ex Squeeze front man) in Newcastle and so I went! What a fantastic show which I could hardly enjoy because I was so tired! He dragged us out i n the street and sang and sang and sang! I would go see him 
again in a second! Super guy! }{\insrsid13843569 [dog that died]}{\insrsid13578975 
's birthday was Tuesday and so got a bit depressed about that. She would've only been 6. poor little angel. I've got the labs here now one has it's fat butt next to me on the sofa. It keeps shoving me over
\par 
\par Busy week all week oh WHEN do I get a day off? Ha! The season is here alrighty! Some idiot spilled wine all over one of the bedspreads last night and didn't say a word ain't people wonderful? 
\par 
\par Funny\'85then I\rquote m to call him! He is still accusing me of \lquote breaking the law\rquote  by changing the locks. Piss off I say. The whole thing is very depressing but it\rquote s something I can\rquote 
t avoid and I just have to keep reminding myself what a complete ass he is. }{\insrsid7175089 J}{\insrsid13578975  helps me to remember how awful he has been to me. Ain\rquote t she wonderful?? 
She checks up on me all the time and comes over every day. L (who has been through this before) checks up on me as well. My friends are wonderful.

nd think too much! How wonderful! Then it got busy and now I'm tired again. I stay in the house MOST of the time because if he's home he comes out to say something nasty to me every time I venture to the shop or pub. Plus I'm afraid to LEA VE unless he's 
gone because I fear he'll break in. R}{\insrsid13843569  }{\insrsid13578975 spies on him for me from his house across the road. He }{\insrsid16594567 [husband]}{\insrsid13578975 
 thinks everybody in this village is HIS friend but the things they say to me NOW that we've begun the divorce!! They HA TE him! He has no idea the nasty f
eelings they harbour for him. The sad thing is, the sad bastard will never know because he doesn't understand and never will. He thinks he's wonderful.
\par Haven't heard from the lawyer this week so I assume things are just rolling along. Don't know how long this stuff takes!!!!!!
\par 
\par Been just hanging out with }{\insrsid7175089 J}{\insrsid13578975 
 and now I've discovered the complete and utter addictiveness of Ebay pet stuff, Squeeze memorabilia, DVDs, CDs lawn mowers, DVD players, CD radio alarm clocks for the rooms I've gone completely MAD. Ah so
 THIS is what broadband is for! If I can't download music }{\insrsid10752677 I}{\insrsid13578975 
'll buy tons of crap I don't need!!!!!! I was reading back through some of the diaries tonight, I sure start writing about a lot of things and never continue on or finish them do you think I have a
 restless mind? Or is it a symptom of depression?? My brain just flits around and my memory is terrible! Well, I'll just write this year off altogether too many BAD things. I'll let time heal me }{\insrsid10752677 I}{\insrsid13578975 
'm not CRAZY , just fumbled up in the head. Once this divorce is over, I'm sure I'll start thinking normally again.
