side more. It was disheartening to sit in the office waiting for telephone enquiries etc that are far and few between at the moment. One piece of good news is there is someone interested in a season pitch. We don\rquote t m
ake as much money for there, but is a guaranteed income - a bird in the hand etc
\par }\pard \qj \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\insrsid8066114 \tab I went into Carlisle on Monday to sort out brochures for this season. Living at }{\insrsid12079500 O}{\insrsid8066114 
 has made me appreciate peace and quiet, so a trip even to a small city like Carlisle drives me mad and I can\rquote t wait to get back home. It was nice to see sheep back in the fields around Longtown. Rather ironic that you notice them as something 
\lquote out of place\rquote . I think of this time last year when it was all just beginning and \lquote can\rquote t believe it\rquote s\rquote  on
ly a year. It seems like this area has been devastated for so long. Perhaps the long winter is due to no proper \lquote farming\rquote  seasons. Funny how we take things for granted.
\par \tab The planning permission for the house was applied for this week. I got a letter from our neighbour Mr.}{\insrsid988456  F}{\insrsid8066114 
 advising that the line we hope to build on may be silt. There are restrictions on where we can build from MOD, so don\rquote t have much choice. I went over to the farm to have a chat with the}{\insrsid988456  F}{\insrsid8066114 \rquote 
s about it. This is the first time I have had a long conversation with the older Mr.}{\insrsid988456  F}{\insrsid8066114  since F.M.D and I didn\rquote 
t know what to say. He looked beaten when I saw him shortly after they took their animals, so it was nice to see him look on form so to speak. They are such a nice family, we\rquote re lucky to have them as neighbours.
\par \tab W}{\insrsid988456 F}{\insrsid8066114 
 has agreed to come over next week to go over what land was used for before which should be helpful. The details for the new electricity supply came but are not very helpful. Our intention was to renew the supply and hook \endash  up po
ints for the caravans. As we had virtually no business last year the funds aren\rquote t there to cover it. The quote for the hook-ups is around the \'a37 \endash 8 K mark and I was expecting half of that. When the quote came in at another \'a3
8, 000 I couldn\rquote t believe it. \'a316 000 is a lot of touring caravans. We need the work done, the supply part is urgent, but I don\rquote 
t know where the money will come from. A few months ago I applied for the interest relief part of the Rural Recovery Fund grant and got a letter back saying it 
had been approved, so I hoped to use this money for electricity. I then got a letter saying the original letter had been a mistake and I couldn\rquote 
t have the money after all. I feel really angry that a new business, one man band painting ceramics figures, gets a grant of \'a315 000 to counter the effects of foot and mouth and we got \'a38 000. It isn\rquote t that I\rquote 
m not grateful for the money we have received, it just doesn\rquote t seem fair. I\rquote m having a difficult time persuading people to come here, as soon as they hear Long
town mentioned I can hear the change in tone. I have to impress those who do come and it will be difficult if the species aren\rquote 
t up to scratch. As a whole, the site is stunning, perfect peace, good walks and plenty of wildlife, but all that will mean nothing if their lights fuse when they get back to their caravans. I\rquote 
m going to telephone David Thornley from Cumbria Chamber of Commerce, who is our business link advisor to see if he can suggest anything.
\par \tab We have one full time and one part time staff here and it has crossed my mind that maybe this we have to be where the savings are made, but I can\rquote 
t do it. Linda is a single mum of two teenage lads who works three jobs to make ends meet. How can I say I can\rquote t afford the \'a327 she takes home? I know she\rquote s worried, she must have noticed how we\rquote 
ve tried to cut back on everything else.
\par \tab Part of the grant we did get went on advertising in the fishing magazines (caravan magazines are too expensive at the moment) and we get a reasonable response from them. I\rquote ve sent ou
t 24 brochures this week and have one booking for the static caravan later in the year from that batch. I\rquote m hoping it\rquote s just that people are delaying booking. I need to send out the letters for season pitches soon and I\rquote 
m dreading any of them telling me they won\rquote t renew this year. They have been very patient with the work that needs done but they won\rquote t wait forever. Part of the cash}{\insrsid12079500  }{\insrsid8066114 
flow problem arises because they pay their pitchers in April, so we have that money then, but they also want to start using th
eir caravans then, so the work has to be done beforehand. Whatever gave me the idea that this venture would be less stressful than running a shop?

easonable numbers of enquires but not many bookings. I have tried to be outside as much as possible as sitting in the office just reminds me of unpaid bills, no bookings etc. At least if I\rquote m outside I can remind myself why we\rquote 
re doing this in the first place.
\par }\pard \qj \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\insrsid8066114 \tab I had an interesting conversation with F}{\insrsid5066970  }{\insrsid8066114 
on Wednesday discussing the compensation farmers had received. His daughter is married to a family who have three farms, all of which lost animals of very high pedigree. The resulting compensation amounted to almost \'a3
1 million for farm, fair enough I thought. He then went on to tell me that this same family had claimed relief from the Community Recovery Fund as well. I\rquote m totally flabbergasted. That recovery fund should surely be for the benefit of those relat
ed to farming who have struggled through the last year. Farm workers who have lost their jobs, or people whose livelihood depended on the farms. Given the amount of paperwork involved in these things, I would have thought someone would be checking the val
idity of the claims.    
\par \tab Things went from bad to worse on Friday when I read the local paper. A pull out section on farming gave details of no less than four different schemes to help farmers overcome foot and mouth related loss of business, all of which i
nvolve grant funding of some description. One or two seemed as if they might be relevant to us from a conservation point of view, but when I contacted them, they only apply to farms. Maybe I\rquote m missing something somewhere. I can\rquote 
t seem to find anyone remotely interested in helping our type of business.
\par \tab Despite that, we have started making plans for the future of the site. We\rquote ve listed all the things that involve time rather than money and will make a start on them. Somewhere down the line, money will be needed, but I\rquote 
ve got enough on at the moment so I\rquote ll deal with those when they arise.
\par \tab Family life hasn\rquote t been too good this week. We\rquote re all feeling the strain of being in the caravan and the really poor weather this week, coupled with the half term holiday has added to the pressure. I\rquote 
m awfully tired at the moment, even though I\rquote m averaging seven hours sleep a night. }{\insrsid5066970 S}{\insrsid8066114  doesn\rquote t sleep very well anyway and I used to say it\rquote s because he worried about things he can\rquote 
t change. Now I\rquote m not so sure. I\rquote ve fallen asleep in the afternoon a couple of times this week, which makes me annoyed because there is so much to do around here. I just can\rquote t get motivated at the moment. I don\rquote 
t consciously go to bed with things on my mind and I\rquote m not aware that I\rquote m \lquote dreaming\rquote  of problems, but I don\rquote t wake up feeling refreshed like I use to.
\par \tab Longtown auction mart opened again this week and seemed to be really busy which is a good sign. An article in the Cumberland News reported figures for the Tourist Information Board showing visitor
s for Carlisle, Brampton and Longtown offices fell from 35 000 to 23 000 compared with previous year. I hope that isn\rquote t a sign of things to come.
\par \tab I am still no closer to solving the problems we have with regard to the facilities on site. I had a call from Business Link telling me that I still had around \'a3900 of our marketing grant to claim. We haven\rquote t, so I know they\rquote 
ve made a mistake but I was tempted to send a claim form anyway. Part of what really gets me down about the grant system in the fact that they don\rquote t seem to keep track of anything so I\rquote m left thinking are we being told there\rquote 
s no money available because they\rquote ve paid out twice over.
\par \tab There\rquote s talk in Longtown of a herd in Cumbria or the North East being slaughtered in the last few weeks b}{\insrsid12079500 e}{\insrsid8066114 cause antibodies were found in the sheep. I checked on the DEFRA website and couldn\rquote 
t find any information so I have to assume it is just talk, because the other alternative doesn\rquote t bear thinking about. We can\rquote t survive a season with no tourists again.
\par \tab I\rquote ve outlined a letter for our season pitch holders, due to go out in early march. We\rquote ve decided to leave the fees as they are this year, partly to compensate for them not being able to use their vans last year and because we haven
\rquote t been able to do any upgrades. If all of them renew it will help the cash}{\insrsid12079500  }{\insrsid8066114 flow a little, so I\rquote m hoping.
\par \tab The fishing should pick up shortly, so with a few good catches reports in the angling papers we might get more business for the next few months.
\par \tab I\rquote ve just read back through this and realised how pessimistic it all sounds. Perhaps for future diaries I should take a walk around the site first, a few bullfinches, voles, deer and rabbits would put things in perspective.

t have OS maps so I phoned the planning department and a nice lady there said not to worry, no details had changed so she would co
py the maps they had from last time, so I duly sent the forms and fee. I received a letter two days later telling me the application is invalid because there are no maps with it.
\par \tab Business link also sent me a letter telling me I should apply for the interest relief part of the recovery fund. This is the same grant that they\rquote ve been \lquote processing\rquote  for almost six weeks and still haven\rquote 
t paid me. These things seem small in the great scheme of life, but I can\rquote t express how angry they make me. As a normally laid back person, these feelings are strong.
\par \tab There was a suspected case of FMD in Yorkshire this week. This one was reported on television rather than being \lquote rumoured\rquote  so it had a much greater effect. Part of me wishes they wouldn\rquote t report these things national
ly as for a few hours I was taken back to last year and sitting by the radio waiting to hear who had gone down next and praying it wasn\rquote 
t any of my neighbours. I think the mere mention of the disease strikes total fear these days. Fortunately it didn\rquote t take too long for the \lquote all clear\rquote  on this Yorkshire front. Or as clear as it can be with their initial tests.
\par \tab   Reading through the local paper gives one perhaps a clearer view of the big picture in the area at present. The property pages are filled with farms for sale and dispersal sales. In some ways, I can\rquote 
t blame farmers for getting out, who would want the heartbreak all over again? All those years of building up stock, to be wiped out in a matter of days. From a more selfish point of view, I hope they stay in farming because all the ones for sale won
\rquote t be kept as farms. They\rquote ll be turned into holiday venues and tourist accommodation, more competition in an already struggling market.
\par \tab It occurred to me this week that I\rquote m smoking more than I ever have before despite my mother\rquote s illness and my resolve to cut down and stop last June. It just never seems like a good time. I\rquote 
ll have to set a date and make a concentrated effort soon. Maybe once the season kicks off and there are a few less financial worries.
\par \tab Family wise things came to a head this week with my fourteen year old son informing us that he\rquote ll leave home when he\rquote 
s sixteen. Apparently he hates living here and wishes we were back in Penrith. I know that much of this stems from us being cooped up in caravan, but it\rquote s difficult to explain why. He sees things in a very simplistic way \endash 
 we sold the house in Penrith, so why don\rquote t we have the money to build a new one? I don\rquote t want them worried about our money situation so although I\rquote ve explained that things will be tight for a while, I haven\rquote 
t given them the full picture. To be \'a320 000 short in a season seems like it should be such a small matter but it can mean the difference between survival or not.
\par \tab I\rquote m starting to prepare for the coming season regards to information available etc. I\rquote ve done new posters for TICs}{\insrsid12079500  (Tourist Information Centres)}{\insrsid8066114  and local pubs etc so I\rquote 
ll put them in next week. I\rquote m going to make a list of all the things I can do that don\rquote t cost anything and get on promoting what I can. Fishing reports etc to the angling papers can bring enquires so I\rquote ll try that. As usual I\rquote 
m somewhat frustrated by the knowledge that if people would visit, they\rquote d fall in love with the place like we did, but short of physically forcing them to come I don\rquote t know how else to persuade them. Another walk for inspiration I think.

\par }{\insrsid8066114 \tab Despite some awful weather I have spent most of this week outside trying to get on with things that take up time rather than money. I\rquote ve avoided the paperwork as much as p
ossible since it always seems to bring more bad news of one kind or another.
\par \tab Last weeks blow out family wise seems to have at least cleared the air a little, so there has been a relative peace. My husband is finally having two days a week off work, so he 
if can relax a little things may get better. The difficulty in working for oneself is that there\rquote 
s little in the way of social life so things get strained, and in our case we tend to blame each other for things not being done. Same old story, I think I hav
e too much to do, he thinks he has. At times we work against each other instead of pulling together. Financial problems }{\b\insrsid8066114 exacerbate }{\insrsid8066114 this problem, so it\rquote s important that we spend time sorting it out.
\par \tab This means of an inquiry into FMD in Cumbria is a mixed b
lessing I think. It is important that people have their say and lessons are learnt, but the bigger picture needs to be looked at. Time and money spent going over out mistakes perhaps takes away from action to prevent these mistakes recurring. Going over t
he past doesn\rquote t necessarily help for the future. It seems to me that the question of what should be happening now to help businesses recover is far more important that what we should have been happening last year. It\rquote 
s too late to change the events of last year but not too late to help with this one.
\par \tab It was interesting to learn that Radio 4 had shown awareness of this study. Much of my frustration stems from the feeling of being \lquote left to get on with it\rquote . It\rquote s difficult to find someone to talk to without fee
ling that I am adding to their burned or that they won\rquote t understand. Those that do understand are in a similar position ourselves so it isn\rquote 
t fair to load more on. I think just to have the feeling that someone had listened and taken our feelings seriously 
would make all the difference. The frustration of having to battle our way through paperwork, getting no information unless we find it ourselves and continually having to make the first move would be worth it if we felt someone was listening. I suppose th
at\rquote s what I think this study will achieve, which is why I agreed to do it.
\par \tab General enquires seem to have slowed a little }{\b\insrsid8066114 ? }{\insrsid8066114 despite the good fishing weather. I\rquote ve put out our catch reports in a number of angling papers and in the local paper which comers ou
t on a Friday so maybe we\rquote ll get more action over the weekend. I have been looking for a caravan late in the year from a woman who visited at the end of last year. It\rquote s nice when people can understand what we\rquote 
re trying to do and appreciate that it takes time.
\par \tab We are due for a visit from the B.H.9.H.P.A Bellamy Award assessor soon. Although we achieved Gold last year, they did comment on the appearance of the car park entrance. We haven\rquote t had the funds to do the necessary work on this yet, so I
\rquote m hoping they will make allowances. Gold on our first attempt was excellent, but won\rquote t be easy to maintain unless the season picks up.
\par \tab We need some good free publicity so I\rquote m making enquires at the moment to find out what events are planned in Longtown for the Golden Jubilee holiday, to see if we can tie in something with it.  Getting local people involved isn\rquote 
t easy, a through back to the problems we had in our first year. The court case for that is due to take place in June (if it isn\rquote t postponed again) so maybe after that we can start again.

\par \tab I have bookings for two of the statics next week, both also interested in fishing so we may be seeing some income there. At least the weather seems to be picking up a little. We\rquote 
ve actually had some sunshine this week. Wednesday was glorious, which was good timing as we had a Countryside Stewardship Advisor visit. He had a good look around and reckons we may be e
ligible for new fencing and hedging grants. We had wanted to turn our field into a hay meadow and although he agreed it was a good idea, condition of the grant involves grazing it for a few months each year. That means buying sheep or allowing another far
mer to put sheep in, with all the associated dangers. A report in the Cumberland News this week reckons FMD could hit just as hard again at present, as the safety measures aren\rquote 
t up to scratch yet.  If we put sheep on and it starts all over again, we\rquote ll be finishes. We couldn\rquote t survive another season like last year. And if we had sheep ourselves, we\rquote d have to close as they wouldn\rquote 
t allow caravans or anglers onto the land. We\rquote ll leave the decision until the last minute. The application is to be in at the end 
of May so we still have a little time. The advisor was optimistic about the site in all other ways, so it is nice to have some positive feedback.
\par \tab We\rquote re getting quite a lot of grief from the anglers at the moment as they have started fishing again after the winter break.  The work that should have been carried out last year is still on hold until we get some money in, so they\rquote 
re not very pleased. Five had said they won\rquote t be buying tickets this year. We did get some coverage in the Cumberland News for last week\rquote 
s catch details and that seems to have sparked some interest from day ticket anglers. Five season tickets is still a big chunk of our income though \endash  I need 80 day tickets to make up. Praying for good weather and big fish is daily routine.
\par \tab We\rquote ve taken out a loan to buy a mini digger to try to do some of the heavier work around the site. Hiring and digger and driver is too expensive and at least this way have something to sell at the end of it. I\rquote 
m hoping we can do some of the work for the new electric\rquote s ourselves to bring the cost down. It will take us longer that a professional but we don\rquote t have an option really.
\par \tab Chris from the bank has sent a gentle reminder about pension planning and writing wills. I know its something we need to sort out but the timing isn\rquote t great. At the rate we\rquote re going we\rquote ll be working \lquote till we\rquote 
re eighty and won\rquote t have anything to leave anyway.
\par \tab There was a public meeting in Carlisle this week with the agenda \lquote lessons to be learn from FMD outbreak\rquote . I went along but it seemed to be the same old people saying the same old things so I didn\rquote t stay very long. The only way we
\rquote ll know if the lessons have been learned is if, God forbid, there\rquote s another outbreak. I still don\rquote t think there\rquote s any point in loo
king back. Far better to spend the time (and money) helping people through today. Again, a small voice that isn\rquote t heard.

There have been plenty of inquires for next weekends Easter holiday so hopefully we should be quite busy. More of the season
 tourers have confirmed that they would like to stay so we should be able to balance out cash flow a bit better in April. I still haven\rquote 
t heard from the Planning Department about renewal of permission for the statics which is a bit worrying. We had hoped these would provide a good income this year. Ideally we\rquote 
d like to sell the ones we have and replace them owner occupied holiday homes from which we would get a sit rent. Last season has made us very aware of how vulnerable we are to trends and setbacks. The
 problem is that the Planning Department have set conditions on the site license and whereby we have to own and let the static caravans which means we have no actual guaranteed income from one month to the next on the site. It makes forward planning very 
difficult, we\rquote re nervous after last season. I\rquote m thinking it might be worth hiring a \lquote Planning Consultant\rquote  to try to vary the conditions. I\rquote ve got the distinct impression that \lquote who you know\rquote 
 plays a very big part in planning decisions.  
\par \tab I\rquote ve spoken to one of our season tourers this week for the first time since her husband died two months ago. It\rquote 
s very difficult to know what to say, but it does tend to put life into perspective. Here is a 39 year old man suddenly taken and leaving a family of four children
 and his wife totally devastated. Makes your realize that life is too short to sweat the small stuff. The worst that could happen to us is that we lose our business and home. We drive ourselves to the point of exhaustion, constantly worrying about the fut
ure when in fact, its out of our hands.
\par \tab There has been a national campaign to promote carvan}{\insrsid12079500 n}{\insrsid8066114 ing and an effort to improve the image of those who take touring caravans on the road. I have to admit that before we bought }{\insrsid12079500 O}{
\insrsid8066114 , my only knowledge of touring vans w
as what I remembered from a holiday to Skegness with my Granny thirty odd years ago. Its changed a bit since then Anything that brings us more business is very welcome anyway. Now all I have to hope for is that the anti hunt campaigners don\rquote 
t turn their attention to fishing.
\par \tab The Cumberland News produced a supplement titled \'93Cumbria\rquote s Story\'94 this week with a sub heading \lquote from chaos and tragedy to hope and recovery\rquote 
. Reading through it and seeing the pictures brought it all back and I was a bit depressed again on Friday. The irony of being told it}{\insrsid12079500 \rquote }{\insrsid8066114 
s under control when all around people were losing theirs. The photo of a solitary lamb sleeping in a field oblivious to the pyres burning behind it is one of the most poignant I have ever seen. It quite simply summed it all up for me. There\rquote 
s all the usual waffle from politicians, MAFF officials etc. and there\rquote s this tiny lamb not knowing its fate. Towards the end of the paper there are the good news articles, people fighting back, recovering from the nightmare. Pho
tos of smiling farmers at re-opened marts, trail hounds, Prince Charles staying at a local B&B. And still the picture of the lamb is the one that won\rquote t leave my head.
\par \tab The paper reported that the slaughter}{\insrsid12079500  }{\insrsid8066114 man who killed his work mate during the crisis was found not guilty. Local opinions varies but the general consensus is that he was slightly annoyed and \lquote mucking about
\rquote  with the gun at the time. One wonders at the balance of his mind, given the stresses of the job he was there to do, but I do feel sorry for the parents and girlfriend of the victim. 
\par \tab Our site is coming into its own now that spring seems to have arrived. I love walking around first thing in the morning when everything else is quiet. The sight of the sun coming up, over sheep in the fields, and hearing the bird\rquote

s a pity a holiday is out of the question this year. WE may be able to get a few days at the end of the season. We\rquote ll follow the example of our visitors and go somewhere in the UK. Devon was badly hit by FMD so maybe there. It\rquote

3000, what a relief it was a miscalculation! I could, of course, get the accountants to do this, but it never seems o justify the cost. I suppose the good news from them is that we don\rquote t have any tax to pay this year, I don\rquote 
t know if I should be depressed about that or not. It wasn\rquote t entirely unexpected, but it does bring home the fact that we\rquote ve worked for nothing this year.
\par \tab A, our grounds man, hasn\rquote t been very well this week, bronchitis, I think. It\rquote s worrying to see him struggle on, but he won\rquote t hear of going off sick. It comes down to different work ethics
 of generations and a sense of loyalty. I know he feels grateful at been kept on last year event though we struggled to keep going. The truth is we would probably had to write this year off too if we\rquote d let him go. There\rquote 
s no way I could run the site on my own. It\rquote s all about first impressions, and he works hard to make sure we give the right one. I\rquote ve insisted he goes to the doctor at least.
\par \tab I went fishing on Thursday evening, which was nice. Didn\rquote t catch anything but was able to watch the life around the lake without disturbing it at least. Our little brood of ducklings has shrunk from 14 to 7 \endash  mink, I suspect.
\par \tab We worked on clearing an area at the corner of the lake which might be useful for picnic tables etc. Its fairly easy to reach and has a stunning view over the lake as the sun goes down. We won\rquote 
t make any money from this kind of thing directly, but it may generate interest in the other aspects of the site. We realise we have to diversify somewhat, but I\rquote m beginning to feel slightly discouraged by th
e lack if progress with the planning department. Ideally, we\rquote d like to create something for everyone to run free of charge, but running costs have to be met somehow. It\rquote s the usual vicious circle \endash  can\rquote 
t provide facilities without money and can\rquote t generate money without facilities. Oh to be an assembly line worker!
\par \tab Our disabled angling group met for the first time this year on Sunday. This is a service we currently provide free of charge \endash  use of the room, tea and coffee etc. In theory, it should pay us bac
k by increasing the number of anglers and caravans we get, but it appears embroiled in petty politics at the moment, so nothing much comes out of it. I don\rquote t want to get too involved in the running of it but things can\rquote 
t stay as they are. It has to be mutually beneficial, for their group as much as our business.
\par \tab I\rquote ve noticed a few adverts on television for local businesses in the last week. I\rquote m assuming they\rquote ve used their marketing grant for these, so I hope it pays off. There\rquote s such a lot of competition a
t the moment. It will be interesting to see how the county marketing campaign works. I can\rquote t help thinking that the Lake District pretty much sells itself. Who could fail to be attracted to such stunning scenery? I\rquote m biased, but shouldn
\rquote t we be promoting t
he lesser known beauty of the whole area? I welcomed the news that the proposals for the Cumbria Rural Action Zone had been approved, only to read that a priority was looking into the viability of attracting cruise ships to the area. Am I mad? Are they? W
ho comes up with these ideas? The Haskins report recommended the focus be placed on viable businesses, those that had a proven record.  We find ourselves in a difficult position because we don\rquote 
t have a record as such but we struggle on to prove ourselves. Isn\rquote t there any help on the cards? I\rquote m becoming more and more jaded by headlines hinting at help on the way then follow up stories about where the help will be directed.
\par \tab I\rquote ve spent hours on the internet trawling through report after report trying to make some basic sense of it all. As usual it seems like time and money going on making things so much more complicated than they need to be, so I\rquote 
ve given up on most occasions.

\par Have had a pretty disastrous week, all down to my own stupidity basically. I rant on about people taken in by con men and almost fall for it myself. Workmen have been digging up the road just outside the gate for the last week, and one of them asked if I
\rquote d like them to do the entrance while they were there. It\rquote s almost time for the BH + BPH inspection and the only negative comment last year was about the entrance so I figured it couldn\rquote t do any harm to improve it a little. It turned 
out the chap who offered had nothing to do with the \lquote official\rquote  workmen and he came to me with a bill for \'a3
1, 800. He turned a bit nasty when I told him what to do with it and as I was here on my own I got a bit nervous. Anger at being ripped off took over t
hough, so I deliberately wrote the cheque out to his company name, knowing full well he would change it, so the bank would refuse it. I had to work in the shop on Wednesday and the bank phoned me there to query it. They refused payment so when I got home 
there was a message from the \lquote workman\rquote . He called in again on Friday but there were more people around. I lied and said I had spoken to trading standards, gave him the details for my solicitor and said I\rquote 
d see him court, at which point he said he\rquote d take \'a3300. Bit of a difference! I can\rquote t believe how stupid I was. I haven\rquote t told }{\insrsid5066970 S}{\insrsid8066114 
 bout it, no sense in causing an argument when its sorted now. Still, it struck me that even after I\rquote d talked to this man about how difficult last year had been, he was still quite prepared to rip me off. What if I\rquote 
d been a pensioner? It crossed my mind to phone the police, but I reckon they\rquote d have put it down to me being stupid enough to agree in the first place. The problem with money being tight is that you try to cut corners and it can backfire. I hope I
\rquote ve learnt the lesson this time. I can\rquote t sleep \lquote cos I\rquote m so annoyed with myself for falling into it.
\par \tab I worked in the shop Wednesday and Thursday and realised how short staffed we are there. It\rquote s such a time consuming service. The shop is still subsidising }{\insrsid12079500 O}{\insrsid8066114  so until we can boost trade here, we can\rquote 
t afford another salary.
\par \tab }{\insrsid3496264 DT}{\insrsid8066114  from Business Link called on Saturday to check the spending of the grant money, i.e. that we\rquote d got the brochures printed, advertising booked etc. 
I had a laugh when he asked how efficient administration had been. I\rquote m still waiting for the finial \'a3400 to be paid. In truth, I\rquote ve given up on it because I\rquote 
ve written three times explaining the breakdown of my figures and sent invoices for more than the value of the claim (maybe that\rquote s what confused them!) but each time they say they can\rquote 
t work it out. David has promised to look into it. He also advised that we may be able to get help with planning consultancy. Having trawled through the outline proposal for Cumbria Rural Action Zone and a structure plan strategy file, I\rquote 
m still none the wiser as to what they actually want for this area. Given how obstructive they\rquote ve been to our house application, I think we need professional help. I don\rquote t want to do anythi
ng to hold up the house planning, but if we can get advice on what the council are likely to pass at least we can start to plan where the site can go from here.
\par \tab I\rquote m still getting plenty of enquires, some from people interested in leaving their caravans here all year round. The council won\rquote t let us do this at the moment, they limit the number, so it\rquote

storing rolling stock at DM Longtown, which borders our site. So apparently they can have trains but we can\rquote t have caravans. I can\rquote t help feeling that we\rquote 
re up against a brick wall here. We need to recover from last year by pushing forward but we have to fight for every inch. I keep hearing about how everyone is doing everything in their power to help businesses affected last year. Leaving farmers asid
e, I feel our type of business, in this area particularly, would be next inline for advice, help or at least some indication that the powers that be are aware of the problem. It would be so much easier to sit back and say \'93sod it, I\rquote 
ve had enough\'94! Let\rquote s see how much wildlife is left when the place is overgrown and teeming with rats as it was when we came. The local plan states that more quality accommodation is needed in the area, so lodges on site would seem ideal 
\endash  not so! They\rquote ll only allow us to have them if we cram four in right by the existing building, so we end up with a \lquote mini housing estate\rquote . Beggars belief!
\par \tab At least the Lakes are fishing well at present. We\rquote ve had the biggest fish so far caught this week and 25Lbs, so I\rquote 
m hoping to make some of the angling papers as well as the Cumberland News. It came from the Lake that only season ticket holders are allowed to fish, so we might tempt a few more.
\par \tab The weather forecast for the Bank Holiday weekend isn\rquote t too bad. There\rquote s lots going on in Longtown as well as our own fishing competition etc, so I\rquote m hoping for a busy weekend. Fingers crossed for the electr
ics. Arthur is still off, so I\rquote m in trouble if anything goes wrong with the hook ups. The majority of our regulars are really good about it, but it\rquote 
s the impression that first time visitors take away that counts just as much. Better cross my toes too.

\par \tab Arthur is still off this week and is waiting for the results of scans and blood tests etc. He says he\rquote s feeling better in himself which is good news, but he\rquote s starting to worry about the work that won\rquote t be done while he\rquote 
s not here. I\rquote ve tried to tell that he wouldn\rquote t be able to do much of it at the moment anyway as we are quite busy with visitors and anglers so we can\rquote t get round with grass cutters etc. He reckons he\rquote 
ll be fit for work next week, so I hope he\rquote s not just saying that because he feels guilty. It\rquote ll be worse in the long run if he comes back to soon.
\par \tab Longtown\rquote s Jubilee Celebrations were a huge success. It was a glorious success. A glorious day and so good to see people relaxed and happy. Much hard work into it so I\rquote m glad it went well. I don\rquote 
t know how many people were in Longtown really, so I have nothing to compare pre foot and mouth, but there was a definite community spirit. 
\par \tab Unfortunately, the weather changed on Sunday. Our disabled angling group had organised a junior and sen
ior angling competition as well as a barbecue in the evening. I felt so sorry for the kids sitting there in the pouring rain, detriment to not give in \endash  a lesson to be learned I think, since the adults called theirs off.
\par \tab Before we took over }{\fs24\insrsid12079500 O}{\fs24\insrsid8066114 , there was a split in the disabled group over something quite petty from what I can gather. We undertook to promote D}{\fs24\insrsid12079500  }{\fs24\insrsid8066114 
Lake as a venue for disabled anglers and have been approached by some asking if they could use it. J C, who owns D Estate, is just getting over his nervousness about the spread of foot and mouth (we couldn\rquote 
t use the lake or river fishing last year) and is keen to establish it again. I tried to point out to our group that they don\rquote t have exclusive use and that in the interests of increasing their members
hip they should be encouraging others, but because it came from the \lquote breakaway group\rquote , they\rquote ve taken the hump. I get the feeling I can\rquote t win. Petty politics breach all levels \endash  so I\rquote 
ll go ahead anyway. If I can push this we would be in with a chance of hosting the Jack Charlton competition there, which is great publicity.
\par \tab Only one electricity trip out this weekend thankfully. I suspect the caravans users tried to use too many appliances at once as it only affected one van, but its still not acceptable anyway. People want to watch the television etc when it\rquote 
s miserable weather. I\rquote m nowhere near getting the money for the upgrades and the whole system is due for checking and inspection as the end of July. Even if Dave Thornley comes through with a contribution from somewhere I\rquote 
m going to need bank borrowing. We seem to be a bit of standstill at the moment as regards to planning and I\rquote m struggling to work up enthusiasm for anything because I know it involves money we don\rquote t have. I\rquote 
m reading in the local paper that everyone and their dog has applied for permission for extending their business, diversifying into tourism etc, and can\rquote t help thinking I\rquote ve got it wrong somewhere.

 solicitor to check that he\rquote d sent a copy of the land register to the council\rquote s solicitor and on a separate note, he said he was waiting for the local police to call as he\rquote 
d been asked to make a supplementary statement for our case against Robert Walker. Alarm bells started ringing as we\rquote ve been a week from trial before and it\rquote s been cancelled. Sure enough, I got a phone call to say it\rquote 
s been postponed for one week, and off the record, they don\rquote t think it\rquote ll be the following week either. I\rquote m totally dumbfou
nded. One man has a petty grudge against us and our lives are supposed to be on hold for two years. The defences haven\rquote t had time to make their case! We\rquote 
d arranged cover for the shop and the site, my mum was coming down to look after the kids, we\rquote d just about psyched ourselves up, and he\rquote s done it again! He\rquote 
s using every trick in the book. Apparently, they had allocated time slots for witnesses and had allowed one hour in my case. I\rquote ve never been inside courtroom and he wanted me questioned for an hour! I can\rquote 
t believe people are allowed to do this. I ended up in tears after speaking to the D.C from Carlisle who have handled the case so far. They\rquote re so sympathetic and sound as angry as I am, but there\rquote s nothing they can do. I\rquote 
ve been so worried and tense about going to court anyway, thinking at least it would be over in about twenty minutes. Now to learn that he\rquote s going to try to drag it out even more, I can\rquote t believe it!
\par \tab The week just got better and better. My fourteen year old son came on Saturday, and couldn\rquote t put a sentence together. I though he was drunk, which was bad enough, but it turned out he\rquote d been smoking cannabis. I\rquote m totally na\'ef
ve about drugs, which is ridiculous in this day and age, but it frightened the life out of me. I couldn\rquote t get any sense out of him on Saturday, so I left him to sleep it off. After the initial shouting match on Sunday (wrong way to handle it, but I
\rquote m not having a good week) I finally calmed down enough to ask why he did it. His response is that he hates living here, is ashamed of living in a caravan, wishes he was back in Penrith and generally thinks life sucks. I\rquote 
m at a loss for what to do now. I\rquote ve tried to explain the situation but he can\rquote t see why we don\rquote t sell up and move back to Penrith instead of  putting everything 
we have into a loss making business. I knew the house thing was a huge issue for him \endash  it is for all of us, made worse by the poor weather we\rquote ve had recently. We\rquote re on top of each other all the time. I\rquote 
m going to have to try to push things along which means more bank borrowing . I\rquote m thinking maybe I also made a mistake by allowing him to stay at school in Penrith and nor forcing him into making friends here, so I\rquote 
ve taken the decision to move him to school in Longtown. I took the cowards way out and said Ullswater school had heard about his episode on Saturday and didn\rquote t want him back, so although he\rquote 
s not particularly happy, he seems to have accepted the decision. Maybe this has cleared the air a little and given him the chance of a new start in time to mak
e a difference. If he has stayed with the same crowd in Penrith, his exams will suffer next year, so maybe this could be for the best.

s put planning applications in for almost every aspect of his business and has had grants to help with his business plan as well as towards the cost of improvements and expansion.  I\rquote ve come to the conclusion that that we\rquote 
ve been sitting back too much.  We\rquote re letting everyone else take the lead instead of just going for it.  I think we both feel so knocked down at the moment.  We\rquote re normally able to balance each other out quite well but not this week.  There
\rquote s just this overwhelming feeling of \lquote what\rquote s the point\rquote .
\par The \lquote Lakes\rquote  at least are still fishing well so the anglers are quite happy.  Our wo
rk to colour the water and clear the weed seems to have paid off.  One of the statics is rented this week too, by an old chap who used to visit the area regularly so he\rquote s been telling me how much has changed.  We\rquote 
ve had a couple of tents on over the week end too, despite the ground being really soggy.  They seemed quite surprised at the facilities we have, so I\rquote m not sure if it\rquote s because they\rquote 
re used to camping in a field or that we are actually getting it right somewhere.  The amount of rain we\rquote ve had has 
shown the car park in its true colours, we had ducks swimming under our vehicles the other day.  Highly amusing to us, but not a very good impression for visitors.
\par I hope I can shake this mood off in the next few days, I need something positive to go at to get back on track.  Sod Walker and the British justice system!
