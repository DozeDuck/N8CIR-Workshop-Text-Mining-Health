      "Friday TB testing on restocking farm. Usual chat and DEFRA comments\n",
      "The meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus. Farmers seem far more upset at the constriction put on them by DEFRA than they do by the loss of stock now, although I know and saw how utterly devastated most were when they were actually diagnosed with the virus and in the week or two following.\n",
      "My work in the practice is becoming less and less FMD orientated as time goes on. Licensing and restocking visits are drawing to a close and we are starting to return to “normal” vet work. My life has been more settled since the end of FMD. Although there was never a real threat of redundancy there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what form work would take during the outbreak - it was never clear whether I would be based at the practice or working as a DEFRA vet from month to month. Now that it is finished (I hope) the practice and my work can get back to a routine and at least knowing where I’ll be based each day, even if not which calls are going to come in.\n",
      "With regard to FMD the biggest influence it has at the moment and over the last week is acting as a listener to farmers who still talk about it (and DEFRA) a great deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 2         \n",
      "Mon  Shap restocking, having to justify visit\n",
      "Wed Melmerby\n",
      " I went to see a farmer this week to do the first inspection of his sentinel animals that he is restocking his farm. In common with many farmers he was unwavering in his conviction that his animals had been deliberately infected and that Tony Blair or DEFRA were the ultimate culprits. The belief is that they want to put farmers out of business. This particular farmer made the very valid point that DEFRA & co had underestimated the resilience of the farming community. I think that this has been very striking.  Considering the strain that they have been under (in some cases worse for those who didn’t get FMD than for those who did) it has been remarkable how little the majority of our clients have changed. Admittedly we see most of them on a professional basis regarding their animals’ health and not their own, but on the whole they seem to have been very forward thinking about the outbreak. Many have taken it as a chance to increase the size of herds and to eliminate many other diseases as well as FMD.\n",
      "Work in the practice has been fairly steady. As week the number of FMD calls is decreasing. One of the problems with doing restocking, licensing and TB calls is that we are on the farm at DEFRA’s instruction. Normally it is the farmer who calls us out and this can cause friction. Anything related to DEFRA will put hackles up 9 times out of 10. It definitely causes stress at times but puts my diplomacy skills into good practice! It sometimes feels as though some farmers just need an outlet and I fit the bill. After agreeing with everything they say and sympathising, it usually smoothes out and ends with a cup of tea, but it does feel as though we have to justify what we are doing much more than prior to February 2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 3\n",
      "This week was the anniversary of the week I went to my first IP and associated slaughter, pyre building etc. At several times during the week I found myself thinking “this time last year I was…” Although obviously not pleasant memories the thoughts did not particularly affect me in a bad way or distract me from work, it just took me back to that time when I had time to think. I went to see a sick horse near Carlisle, which is where the IP was, and it was interesting to drive past the farm and see animals in the buildings again. Hopefully the farmer concerned is getting back on track again.\n",
      "With respect to daily routine, work is getting very busy. Lambing time is starting to really get going with the inevitable increase in calls. Although it can be hectic at times it’s better to be kept busy rather than having it too quiet. It’s also good to actually be doing lambings and other sheep work as it’s two years since we did any apart from euthanasing sheep last year.\n",
      "On Monday I went to do a re stocking check on a farm. The farmer is convinced he was given FMD deliberately and on arrival I was given his weekly tirade regarding DEFRA, Tony Blair, how I must have made thousands of pounds out of it etc etc. After sometime of not rising to the bait he calmed down and half an hour later was sweetness and light. Perhaps he just needs someone to let pressure out to. Only one session like that a week isn’t too bad considering how many farm visits we do!\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 4\n",
      "Monday brought another dressing down from the farmer I mentioned last week. It was shorter and less passionate this time -  perhaps he’s mellowing a bit.\n",
      "I drove up to Junction 40 one day with the sun out. It reminded me of a similar day a year ago when I could count 15 smoke plumes from pyres on the same bit of road. As I said last week anniversary memories like this aren’t especially difficult for me, they’re just there. In a lot of ways it’s quite satisfying thinking about what was happening a year ago and how well things have progressed since then. Most of our farmers have re stocked, work is returning to normal. Even things like being able to drive onto farms again rather than having to leave the car at the farm entrance makes a big difference.\n",
      "Work continues to be very busy with the typical seasonal calls to sheep and cattle. We have a couple of vet students doing work experience with us which had to stop last March as we couldn’t take extras onto farms with us. Another sign of the continuing return to normality. Some days it seems as if we have returned to how we were a year ago. The most obvious legacy is perhaps the thorough and extensive clothing disinfection between each farm - a good habit which is very hard to break!\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 5\n",
      "I had to work on Easter Monday morning, which was fairly uneventful. As for the last few weeks there were the usual seasonal calls to sheep and cattle, but nothing too stressful.\n",
      "On Tuesday I did the final blood sampling on the last farm that we have that is still at the sentinel stage of re stocking. The farmers seemed fairly mellow today and spared me the usual lecture/attempt at argument. Perhaps it’s because the end of his restriction is in sight. The test went very smoothly, and I didn’t hear from him until the end of the week, when I (he?) was upset (probably justifiably) that his results still weren’t back. As processing the bloods is not our responsibility all I could do was sympathise and plead ignorance!\n",
      "The rest of the week was fairly routine work-wise. Friday was taken up doing a big tuberculin and brucellosis test on a re stocked farm. They all have to be done within 3 mths of re stocking. Although it was a big job it was a well run farm with plenty of help, so we got finished within the day and with as few delays as could be expected.\n",
      "Now that the evenings are lighter it’s meant that on nights off duty I’ve been able to get out more. It’s made a very welcome change to be able to bike/walk on the fells again this year after all the restrictions of 2001. Long may it and the weather continue!\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 6\n",
      "Finally finished the last a restocking jobs on Monday.\n",
      "The farmer was getting very frustrated (probably justifiably so) at the length of time it was taking - the bank holidays etc last week meant to that the labs were closed so that blood samples took longer to process. I got the results at 4. 45 Monday evening and in an attempt to create some goodwill agreed to go to the farm to do a final check that evening. On arrival of the usual tirade about DEFRA and vet's came my way which was slightly hard to take. He then said that he didn't blame me personally which was nice of him. I think (hope) he realises that we can only try to get things going faster and ultimately it’s out off our hands. At least it's good to have all the restocking work finished. It feels as though the first stage is over in getting back to where we were. Another sign of returning to usual is the continuing pace of work. Nights on call are again a time for working rather than the call free nights of summer 2001. This week has brought early-morning lambing  most days. The rest of the time we’re is as busy as it's been for a year. The day book is full each day and we all seem to be driving around the county more or less keeping up with the jobs! (which is a good thing!) I had the weekend off and was going to go to Edinburgh to see some friends, but in the end stayed in Penrith for some R&R!\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 7\n",
      "I had a half-day on Monday and went to Riggindale at the head of Haweswater with a friend who had come to stay for a night or two. The plan was to see the golden eagles nesting that up to unfortunately they were off on a day trip to another part of the Lake District. But the weather was good and it made a very pleasant change from work.\n",
      "The practice is still going flat out with seasonal work. The daily flow of lambing and lambing related sheep problems shows no sign of ebbing.  There are also increasing numbers of cattle problems probably related to coming towards the spring turn-out of cattle that have been inside for 6-7 months.  The fact that most of them are in new surroundings is almost certainly adding to the problems. On the whole of farmers are fairly pragmatic about the difficulties they are having. Most accept that they were bound to have problems with the restocking and on the whole are pleased just to have stock on again. Some are very keen to be as efficient as possible whereas others will more readily go along with the old farming mantra that \"where there's a livestock there's a dead stock\" (Not quite what the veterinary profession wants to encourage!)\n",
      "I was on call at the weekend and had one of the busier few days I can remember. Again it was mostly seasonal farm work, which although it was time-consuming is often quite rewarding. I'm still surprised by the number of sheep we are getting called to - perhaps it's because farmers have spent a lot of money on them to restock with and now feel they’re financially worth calling us for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 8\n",
      "Made a couple of visits to one of our farmers who restocked over the winter this week. He's having a few problems with cows getting ill and generally not settling in very well.  He's one of the most amenable farmers on our books and never seems to try to blame anyone for his troubles. At times it's very frustrating not to be able to do more for people like him. I'd like to be able to give every one of his cows a magic injection and say that it'll get better but unfortunately that's not how it works!\n",
      "We've had a lot of colt castrations to do this week, which is normal for this time of year. It puts more pressure on us in terms of work as we usually take two vets to each castration.  Considering how busy it is relations in the practice are generally very good. It has been stressful at times but on the whole this has been stress related to volume of jobs to do rather than people. It has also been a very different (and preferable) type of stress than this time of the last year. At least a lot of work makes us all feel fairly stable rather than the terrible uncertainty of last year. We’ve also taken on an extra vet this spring which would have been unthinkable last year.\n",
      "In the middle of the week I did a farm visit with one of the vets from the local Veterinary Lab to discuss disease control on a re-stocked farm. Most of the work into disease surveillance on a farm was DEFRA funded which went down well with the farmer.  She at least felt as though she was getting something back after fighting with DEFRA for the last few months. It was also encouraging to see someone taking a very positive approach to disease control in the future.\n",
      "My cousin and some of his friends came down from Glasgow for the weekend to go into the Lake District. The weather was good on the whole and several people noted how good it was to have the paths open again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 9\n",
      "  Started the week doing a big tuberculin and brucellosis test at a restocked farm. There has been a big backlog to clear after testing was stopped during FMD last year so we have to catch up with those farms that didn’t get the disease but are due a test as well as testing the restocking farms. We’re all very keen to keep Cumbria as a TB free zone, but with all the different stock coming in it’s going to be tricky. Monday’s test was long but okay on the whole. The set-up was good and the farming family were very pleasant which makes a huge difference to how the day goes! All was clear when I went to read the test on Thursday - a relief for all concerned.\n",
      "Overall work seems to be quietening down a bit this week compared to the last few.  We are now just busy rather than always feeling as if were one job behind all the time. On Wednesday and Thursday one of our clients brought in half-a-dozen Shetland ponies to castrate .It makes a change to have a \"large animal\" that is small enough to be easily physically restrained by one person.  The continuing good weather made doing an afternoon's work with the ponies in the practice’s field a very pleasant way to spend a few hours (I can't help feeling that no rain in April means we'll get loads later in the summer!)\n",
      "I was on a second call at the weekend. Saturday was very busy with small animal jobs which I mainly left to a colleague while I tried to clear up the farm and equine jobs.  Calm was pretty much restored by late afternoon, after which I wasn't called until early Sunday morning. Another of our re-stocked clients is having considerable trouble with some of his new animals and is becoming increasingly frustrated about it. We all try to help with the medical side of it (animals) but inevitably also get to hear a lot of his other worries too. Hopefully things will look up soon and he'll be able to ride it out OK.\n",

      "Had a day off on Bank Holiday Monday - always the good way to start the week. I went up to Peebles in Scotland with some friends to go mountain biking. It was surprisingly empty for a weekend and the weather was good, and I didn't fall off - all in all, a good day out!\n",
      "Tuesday was work as usual. I had to do a small TB test on a restocking farm. It shouldn't have been a long job but the facilities weren't great, so it didn’t go as slickly as it might have done. We all managed to get through in one piece so it could have been worse.\n",
      "One of my colleagues went on maternity this week. She is part time but does all small animal work. Now that she's off for the next few months it means that an extra vet is needed each morning to stay in and do small animal operations. While it's probably not my favourite sort of work it does make a change from being out on farms every morning. It's also good to get a bit more experience at small procedures.\n",
      "As well as doing smaller animals this week has brought several interesting equine cases. I had to hospitalise a horse for a few days for fairly intensive treatment which fortunately appears to have made a good recovery. There have also been a couple of horse operations at the practice this week. They’re generally quite interesting apart from the stress involved with having half a ton of horse asleep on the operating table!\n",
      "I had the weekend off and went to Edinburgh for a small reunion with friends I was at college with. Although we do talk about other things conversation inevitably came round to work. The effect of FMD and its consequences are still very much in people's minds. Friends all asked how it was last year and whether farms have restocked yet etc etc. It ‘s stuff which I seem to have said hundreds of times over the last few months, but people never seem to tire of asking it, and, to an extent, I don't seem to get bored of answering it. \n",

      "Diary 11\n",
      "The week started with a big TB test at a restocking dairy farm. There were very good facilities and it subsequently went very smoothly and quickly despite the number of cows involved. The farmer seems to be quite positive about the new start and has been spared a lot of the problems that other people have experienced while restocking in terms of disease in the animals. Everything was clear when I read the test later in the week\n",
      "On Wednesday afternoon I had a bit of a change as I went castrate two ponies belonging to my mother. She had bought two totally wild Fell ponies last autumn. They now a bit tamer, but not completely used to being handled yet. I went with one of our nurses and the senior partner, and it all went pretty much to plan. \n",
      "Work is still busy. There's one client in particular who is giving us a lot to do.  He restocked a few months ago and is obviously having trouble lambing his sheep. It got a bit trying when I had to get up to his third lambing of one night, but that's what we are there for I suppose! He's a nice man and always seems pleased to see us, which helps.\n",
      "I had the weekend off again and went to Glasgow to be best man at my cousin's wedding. Apart from the weather it went very well (I think) with no unsolvable problems! \n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 12\n",
      "Started the week with a long visit for dairy fertility work to one of our big dairy farmers. It's one of the farmers who has been having problems after restocking and a visit that another vet usually does, so I felt a bit under pressure. It's the type of work, which is very routine but has the potential to go quite badly wrong. On the whole it went fairly well with no major problems. I get on pretty well with the farmer which always helps as it makes the time go by quicker.\n",
      "Small animal work is still quite busy. I had two days inside this week doing small animals operations.  There wasn't anything particularly different or unusual, but it still helps to do more of it.\n",
      "One of our farmers who managed to miss FMD is very busy with his calving schedule at the moment.  He’s tending to have very big calves, and subsequently we’re doing a lot of Caesareans there. This week has brought at least half-a-dozen, of which two were in the middle of the night - there have been a few vets are looking sleep deprived recently!  I had the weekend off and went so see a couple of friends in Edinburgh. We spent one day cycling in Peebles and then proceeded to nothing strenuous for the next!\n",
      "\n",
      "Diary 13\n",
      "The week started with a big session dehorning cattle. It’s not exactly technical work and is fairly hard work – at least it gets me fit! We would normally do them at a younger age but quite a few have been missed as we didn’t get out onto farms for such routine work last year.\n",
      "On the whole most people are fairly well caught up now that they’ve re-stocked/been having routine work done for the last 8 months or so, but there are still a few lagging behind.\n",
      "I had a call from a farmer who was one of our most consistently and vehemently anti-DEFRA people last year. I ended up doing a Caesarean and had quite a long chat with him. Conversation ended up coming round to the events of last year and he aired his resentments again. It was the first time in several weeks that I had heard this kind of talk, whereas a few months ago it would have been a daily occurrence. It wasn’t particularly aimed at me or the practice in particular but just frustration with the system as a whole.\n",
      "I went for a walk up Blencathra one evening during the week, but the highlight of the week has to be the start of the World Cup. I’ve been on duty this w/e but managed to see all but the last two minutes of this morning’s rather disappointing draw with Sweden. Most farmers are keen to watch the matches too, so lets hope not too many calls come in at the wrong time!\n",

      "I had the bank holiday on Monday off, which was welcome, after a weekend on call. I went for a walk in the lakes with a colleague. Considering it was a bank holiday it wasn't too crowded. Had to work on Bank Holiday Tuesday though. It wasn't especially busy until the evening when I had to do a Caesarean on a cow and then go and see a badly cut horse. Both seem to be doing OK.\n",
      "The rest of the week was worked as usual. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary happened with fairly routine calls. Perhaps it was because everyone was preoccupied with events in Japan and Korea? Or maybe that is just me. I was booked in for an 11 am call on Friday, but managed to persuade the farmer concerned that 9.30 would be more appropriate, said that I, (or should that be we?) could watch the second England game. We managed to get finished in time and it was well worth it. The 1-0 win over Argentina put everyone in a good mood for the rest of the day and the weekend.\n",
      "I was on first call over the weekend. Saturday morning was very busy and we didn’t get all the calls done until early afternoon. After that it was one of the quietest weekends I’ve had. They were a couple of things to do on Saturday afternoon - evening, but Sunday had no calls until after lunch - almost unheard of. I had to check my phone was switched on! Long may it last!\n",

      "I’ve done two days in the practice doing small animals this week, more than usual. The weather has not been the best so it's no bad thing. I managed to go out on rounds on Wednesday though, so I managed to catch the third England match. Second round here we come!\n",
      "I spent most of Friday morning operating on two cows at one of our farms.  They both had a condition where part of the gut displaces in the abdomen, and is best repositioned surgically. The farmer observed that it was probably linked to FMD last year. Because of FMD he had to use more silage to keep his cows inside last summer. This meant he had less stored over the winter and so had none available to feed this spring/summer. The lack of silage now is almost certainly implicated in the problems his cows had. It's very unusual to have two occurring on one farm at same time. Seeing as he missed getting FMD last year though, he thought it was a price worth paying! It was actually quite a pleasant way to spend a morning - he's from Kirkby Stephen, where I went to school, and I didn't have any other jobs waiting, so it was quite a relaxed few hours. (the surgery went OK too!)\n",
      "I had a half-day on Friday and drove to valley just beyond Alston to meet one of my old flat mates from Edinburgh for his stag weekend. We stayed in an old barn in middle of nowhere, so it wasn't exactly a conventional stag party, but very enjoyable all the same. We walked to the nearest pub on Saturday to see England's exciting next instalment 3 - 0. Thank you very much. \n",
      "After that it's been a leisurely day and drive back to Penrith. And I’ve got another night to get my head back to normal for work tomorrow. \n",

      "This week has been quite small animal orientated again. I've done two mornings in the surgery and more consulting than usual.\n",
      "I'm not meant to be on duty for nights this week but I've had a couple to cover for people who've been on holiday. Fortunately both nights were fairly quiet. I'm sure the favour will be returned sometime! During the day work has been fairly steady. We’re not quite as busy as last week, but there's enough to keep us going.\n",
      "The practice like most of the country, tried to stop briefly while England were losing to Brazil. It's a bit disappointing - hopefully farmers and the rest of our clients won’t be too depressed about it all. It was good while it lasted!\n",
      "At the weekend I went down to a place near Worcester for the wedding of the friend whose stag weekend it was the last week there were a lot of people from Edinburgh there why haven't seen for several years and it was great to catch up. The weather was very kind and stayed dry.\n",

      "On Monday I went to do a big tuberculosis and brucellosis test at of one our big dairy farms that had restocked few months ago. They’ve got several hundred cows and it took a lot longer than anticipated - I had to go back on Tuesday to finish the job off. They’re a friendly family so it wasn't really too much of a chore. There has been a more obvious change in them since FMD than for most of our clients who had the disease. They seem much quieter and less concerned about farming and life's problems in general now. Perhaps they think if they can get through 2001 then there’s nothing worth getting stressed about in comparison! \n",
      "Wednesday was spent doing small animal work - made a change as on Thursday I went back to read the cows results for the TB test (all negative).\n",
      "On Thursday night I drove down to stay with a college friend near Birmingham for the start of a long weekend. On Friday I carried on south to another friend in north Devon. She's working (another vet) in an area that was also severely affected by FMD. Cumbria was so badly hit that is sometimes easy to forget that other places had a bad time too. Thankfully work in Devon is more or less back to normal again.\n",
      "I spent the rest of the weekend in South Devon where my dad had his 60th birthday. We were lucky with the weather and had fine (ish) conditions to have a barbecue on the beach. I was off today (Monday) as well, and spent the day driving north. Too far to go for a weekend!\n",

      "Work has generally been a bit quieter recently. This is fairly typical for the time of year, mainly because animals are outside and farmers are busy making hay and silage (rain permitting). We've had two vets off this week so although there have been fewer jobs in we are not left twiddling our thumbs. There has been the usual flow of a routine farm work along with horses and small animals, but nothing too taxing on the whole.\n",
      " I had a night on Thursday and went up St Sunday crag in the Lake District, with a couple of friends from Brampton.  It was further than I remembered it being - we didn't get down until it was almost dark. But apart from being unseasonably cold (surprise, surprise) it was a fine night.\n",
      "It was duty this weekend. I was on first call on Friday night and had it very easy (no calls) until 12:45pm when another vet and I had to operate on a dog until three am. I checked it again at 5.30 and then had to go to calving at 6.45. Just as that was finished I was called to a badly cut horse, then some lame cows, and then to the bacon roll shop for breakfast!\n",
      "I was only on second call for the rest of the weekend and was fairly quiet. This meant I could get on with various mundane things like painting my house, tidying the garden etc etc - ideal tasks for when I can't do anything else because I'm on call. And the dog did well! So it makes the night with no sleep worthwhile\n",

      "Have had another short week - had Monday off as I was coming back from a long weekend away. Work this week has been fairly steady. Farmers are often busy trying to get silage/hay in at the moment so routine of vet work takes a back seat. Having said that we have been kept at least as busy as we would expect with routine fertility visits and the occasional sick cow etc. There been a few of the restocking farms that have had some fairly unusual diseases that didn't obviously fall into the ones we usually recognise or deal with. As a lot of them have bought stock in from abroad we have to at least keep in mind the possibility of new problems been brought in. \n",
      "We've worked quite closely with the local DEFRA-run Veterinary Investigation Centre on a few of these cases but thankfully none have turned out to be anything to be unduly worried about.\n",

      "2 vets have been off this week so it's been a bit busier for the rest of us. Again as with last week it's been a mixture of routine and the standard A&E type work. There have been a few tuberculin tests going on, still trying to clear the backlog from last year. It's getting there slowly but a lot of it will have to wait until the autumn/winter when the cows are in and the farmers have more time available. Our new vet who started in April has seemed to settle in very well. He had a bit of a bad day earlier in the week when a calving did go quite as planned. It's very easy to do, especially when you feel under pressure as is bound to happen when you start a new job. It reminded me of some of the problems I had a few years ago! The farm where it happened is quite an understanding type so it won't create any real problems.\n",
      "Hockey training is starting again which seems a bit premature as the season is still months away. At least it'll encourage me to do a bit more exercise to get fit for matches. The weather has meant I haven't been out into the hills as often as I would have liked but hopefully there's still time for it to brighten up a bit!\n",

It may be that a lot of farms have now largely got their crops in and are trying to catch up, or perhaps it's just the way things go. Several farms have had ongoing problems this week with visits being required several days running. There have also been a large number of horse calls. This is probably fairly common for this time of year as they tend to get ridden in the (supposedly) better weather. We tend to go further afield for horses - on Tuesday I went to Kirkby Lonsdale area in morning and had to go north of Carlisle in the afternoon the miles get racked up or fairly quickly and I get to learn where the\n",

Being on duty for three week nights tends to limit what I can do apart from work, but I managed to meet up with some friends working in Brampton one night and go for a walk in the lakes on Thursday. The weekend was fairly quiet, but I was only on second call so I found time to do some decorating in the room in my house which is the current project. (I lead such a thrilling life! ?!)\n",

We've had time to have coffee and lunch breaks and actually talk to colleagues from time to time. I wouldn't want have every week is quiet as this, but occasionally it's very welcome. It's quite relaxing to be able to go on a call knowing that there is not another one waiting. It also means that if the afternoons are quiet one of us can usually have a half day. I got the nod on Wednesday and went down to Kirkby Stephen to see my folks. They’ve got a smallholding down there with various creatures which usually have some ailment or other. It's a bit of a busman's holiday going there but it is nice having them close - I tend see them every week or two. On Wednesday I vaccinated a couple of horses and trimmed a few sheep’s feet. They went through the joys of 48 hourly surveillance inspections last year but somehow managed to come through unscathed - their parish was one of the only ones in the Kirkby Stephen area to do so.\n",
      "Other weekend I went up to Glasgow to see a cousin who was having a leaving party. I didn't know many people there but it was good to go and do something completely removed from the usual.

He's imported a small herd from Holland and seems very pleased with them so far. It takes a bit time for the F & M farmers to get used to their new stock as most of them knew their old ones so well. But on the whole people seemed fairly content with their new ones.\n",

It was generally fine weather and there were some truly stunning teams of horses in the driving event.

I quite enjoy the horse side of the job so doing a bit more than usual has been a welcome change.\n",

When I know I've got a lot of free time nights tend to get booked up seeing people from home or near by who I’ve temporarily lost touch with. Also seeing as summer seems to have found us I've been trying to get into the lakes as much as possible – the house can wait till winter!\n",

I had swapped duty to be off on the night from 6:00pm.  - at 5.45 four calls all came in at once at all four corners of the practice, so I didn't actually get finished until nearly 8pm .

About 28 people came, most of whom I haven't seen for least a year or two. Nobody seems to have changed much and it was great to see them all again. The garden and house have both taken a bit of a pounding but I think most of the mess is fairly superficial!\n",

It was well beyond the stage where it could have been stitched when I saw it, so it'll have to heal slowly by filling the wound in. I'm sure it'll be fine, but it's going to take a long time.\n",
      "We’re starting to get a lot of inquiries about the new rules DEFRA are bringing in to allow farmers to bring animals on to their farms in isolation facilities. It should make things less restrictive for the farmer. We are going to have to do a lot of inspections.

      "We have done the first of the inspections for the new on-farm isolation facilities for sheep. On the whole farmer compliance has been very good. There have been a few whinges about why they have to do it, and I can see why as it must be frustrating to suddenly be told how to run stock movements that they've always done a different way. Most can see why DEFRA are insisting on it though as it's all aimed at reducing the risk of having another situation like we did last year.\n",

Further education is not compulsory and there is no formal structure for it (which is quite controversial in some people's eyes), but the Royal College of vets do encourage us to keep up-to-date. There is a quota we’re asked to fulfil each year and these three days will help me keep on track. There were several different courses on each day, with one lecture theatre for practitioner based subjects that we could expect to see on a day-to-day basis, and another called \"advanced clinical sessions\" on subjects and cases so obscure that you'd be lucky to hear of one, let alone see one, more than once or twice.

I did a big routine fertility visit to one of our dairy farms on Wednesday. One of the main things we do on these visits is manual pregnancy diagnosis. It's not too bad with dairy calves cows as if they're not in calf they would normally get another chance to do so, but with some beef farms or a dairy cow that is persistently not conceiving , it sometimes more economic to get rid of the cow of rather than persisting. So there's a big incentive for us to get it right, or at least not to say a cow isn't in calf when she is (luckily they were all quite straightforward this week)\n",

      "We flew to New Orleans for a week, supposedly for some sun in the Deep South, but landed just as a tropical storm hit the mainland. Everything was closed for two days (as bad as UK when it snows). Once the weather cleared it was fine and we again went about being tourists - paddle boat up the Mississippi River, out on a boat in the Louisiana swamps to look at alligators, and a bit of New Orleans nightlife.\n",

      " First week back after America. Had a good trip, but the week has been rather marred by the death of one of the hockey team (and a year-mate of mine at school) in a tractor accident when he was hit by a wagon on the A 66 on Thursday. I saw him on Wednesday night at hockey training. He was very stiff having done the Great North Run with his wife the weekend before. I didn't know him very well at school but have got to over the last few years via hockey and he really was a tremendously good person and will be much missed by lots of people in and around Kirkby Stephen. The weekend's match was postponed as no one could have thought about playing - it all seems very trivial when this sort of thing happens. I couldn't have played anyway as I'm on duty this weekend, but fortunately it's been fairly quiet so far - a calving and 2 Caesareans, but it's getting into calving season so it's about par for the course.\n",
      "The first half of the week was OK. I was even given a half-day on Tuesday - a day and a half after returning from holiday. I went for a walk at the bottom end of Derwent Water, and then tried to sleep off some jet lag.\n",

      "I went to Matthew's funeral on Tuesday. How popular he was was reflected in the number of people there. We arrived 25 minutes before it was due to start and still had to stand, and had to move up as more people tried to fit into the chapel. It almost seemed as if all of Kirkby had come to a standstill. It went on quite a long time so I had the afternoon off and went to see my parents (who live near Kirkby) afterwards.\n",
      "We cancelled hockey training on Wednesday as it seemed too soon to go on as usual, but decided play our Scheduled match on Saturday. Both our team and the opposition had two minute silence before the match. We ended up drawing 0 - 0, but it was a very good close game (we normally lose to this team), and played in a competitive but fair spirit. Just what was needed for our first match back. I'm actually on duty again this weekend but one my colleagues covered for me for a few hours so I could go to play.\n",
      "The cases at work have been fairly steady this week. I'm going to enrol for a further qualification in Equine practice in the next week or two. I'm doing a reasonable amount of horse work at the moment, but will try to do a bit more over the next few months/years. It should motivate me to read up on cases more and find slightly more constructive ways to spend evenings on call!\n",

      "TB testing! Our biggest beef herd had its post restocking test this week. About 600 cattle were to be done. There’s no way it could be done in one go so we did it over 3 instead (originally planned for two, but ran out of daylight). It all went smoothly on the whole (or at least as well as could be expected), and everything has been cleared as negative. I found out from DEFRA a few weeks ago that there have actually been quite a few TB cases in the county since restocking. As we'd been clear for years previously to FMD this is obviously a bit of a worry. We haven't had any cases in our practice but if we can't stamp out these new cases as they are found it’s only a matter of time before it spreads further afield. The more we get in the county also means there will have to be more testing. At the moment it's begrudgingly accepted by the farmers, but if we have to do more I can see them having a sense of humour failure over it. Ultimately it's in their interest for us to check that their herd is free, but it is a big time commitment and they don't get paid for it.\n",
      "While I spent two days testing the rest of the week had a bit more variety. I saw few horses, mainly lameness, but also one or two with other ailments. I have to write a casebook for the Equine certificate I'm doing I’m on the lookout for suitable cases during my rounds.\n",
      "I had the weekend off - played hockey in Manchester and then went to Worcester to see some college friends. I had to drive back via Ely (!) as the trains are cancelled due to the winds, which meant a friend was stranded. Not a very direct route to Cumbria. \n",

      "The week started on Monday morning with another TB test on a restocking farm. It's not a big farm and was one of the late ones to get FMD. It's run by a very nice but quite intense family. The son has taken re-stocking very seriously and has obviously thought of it very much as an opportunity to start from scratch and try to eliminate some of their previous herd problems. I have consequently spent quite a bit of time advising him over the various vaccines available and their relative pros and cons. Thankfully things seem to be paying off so far with few problems in herd. One of the things that I noticed during the test was that they made one or two jokes about last year (sorry - forgotten exactly what they said). I thought the fact that they were able to now talk about FMD like that had to be a good sign, as I think it would have been highly unlikely a year ago. \n",
      "On Wednesday afternoon I went up to Wigton to vet a horse for a potential buyer. There were several minor things wrong with it but overall it seemed OK. It's always a responsibility vetting horses as someone is either trying to buy it or not on the basis of what I find. In this case it took quite a lot of convincing the buyer that the imperfections were not that serious. (Hopefully they won’t subsequently turn out to be a problem!)\n",

I have to wait until next year to find out whether I've been accepted, and won't sit them until 2005. I was off this weekend and played hockey in Manchester. Unfortunately we didn't win. Maybe next week. Saturday evening I went down to Kendal to see an old flatmate who lives there.\n",

      "On Tuesday I went to see a horse near Carlisle. It had developed a swelling on its lower jaw that was fairly painful to touch. They were a few possibilities but the most likely was that it had at tooth root abscess. I put it on to antibiotics, but seeing as it had obviously been going on for a while, thought it was worth taking some X-rays. There was obvious destruction of the tooth visible on the X-ray, which probably means it needs removing. This is a fairly major undertaking on a horse and as it was a valuable creature still in training I thought it best to send to Edinburgh vet school to have it done. Hopefully I'll be able to go and see it done in a day or two's time.\n",
      "One of the aspects (drawbacks? (not really!)) of being a vet his that one is often asked about animal ailments out of work. (I’m sure it happens a lot in other jobs too.) My mother is very adept at this not that I really mind. Her elderly terrier that we grew up with has started having one or two problems recently. I suggested a few possibilities but thought it best if she went to the local vets to have her looked at. The problem was she was so bad tempered (the terrier) that they couldn’t safely blood sample her, so she had a day out to Penrith so that I could try to take blood from her. I managed to more-or-less intact, and fortunately her results seemed more or less in order (or at least better than her temper).\n",
      "The general work in the practice has been fairly steady this week. A few farmers seem to be having quite a few cows calving at the moment which is a bit unseasonal, but I suppose a reasonable number tend to calve all-year-round. We haven't really got into calf pneumonia season yet but it can't be long before they start to keep us busy. It will soon take over from lungworm as the main bovine respiratory problem.\n",

As I was in Edinburgh last weekend I decided to stay up for few days. This was partly to see friends and also because I had referred the horse with a bad tooth that I mentioned last week. (voluntary work experience during time off - dedication or very rash?). I spent Tuesday at the vet School in Edinburgh with one of my old tutors. The case I had sent up was successfully treated (so far) by removing the offending tooth. It was very interesting to see how he did it as he used a different technique to the one we’ve used in the practice. I spent the rest of the day there with him seeing other cases. It felt a bit odd being there not as a student. I came home on Tuesday evening and went down to Kirkby Stephen to see my folks on Wednesday morning. I spent most of the rest of the week either at their house or mine doing things like stocking up on firewood for the winter, sorting my house out and making a start on stripping the wallpaper in my hallway. I normally go away when I take time off but it was actually very nice to do things at home for change. It made for quite a relaxing week on the whole!\n",

      "On Tuesday I went back to see the horse that had had its tooth removed last week. It's doing very well and is back in training. It was eating very well as soon as the tooth came out - it's amazing how animals often seem to deal with pain so stoically. I'll check it again next week and, all things being well, that should be it.\n",
      "On Tuesday afternoon I happened to see another slightly unusual case in a horse. It had developed a lump on the outside of its cheek which on closer inspection turned out to be a large mass (man?) inside its mouth. It's probably going to have to be removed and should come in next week for it to be done.\n",
      "The rest of the week was the usual mix of more routine cases. Have been on to more farms this week than I have done for a while. We recently took on a new dairy farm near Appleby and I went to see a cow there for the first time. On a first visit you always hope for something straightforward so that it's easy to make a good first impression. On this occasion the cow was very sick and wasn't really giving me many clues as to why. All I could do was treat it for the symptoms it was showing. I saw it twice on Friday and again on Saturday and by evening it was on the mend. I never did reach a conclusive diagnosis but I think the farmer was satisfied by the fact that it had got better in spite of not knowing quite what was wrong!\n",

In some ways it's not a bad thing as it makes for a fairly stress-free time. It's not that you can really switch off but it does mean that when there are a few fairly straightforward cases to see it's possible to spend more time chatting to the farmer/owner without having to work too hard finding what's wrong with the patient.\n",
      "This week's most interesting case was a horse with amazingly extensive arthritis in its hind legs considering its age. It's not a terminal condition but it does have implications as to what it will be possible to use it for in future. In situations like that it can be quite difficult to give the client the right outlook. They often expect a quick cure, especially in a young horse and to tell them that a problem has been present for months, if not years, and will never completely go away can come as a bit of shock. The owner in this case was very sensible and seemed to taking what was said very well.\n",
      "The other good thing about this week is that I'm having a very good run with my duties - I've been on for two nights on first call and the phone hasn't gone once - very unusual and very welcome! (this must be tempting fate...)\n",

In my rush to get defrosted in my car afterwards I forgot to shut the gate in the field where I had parked. On my return to the surgery I was greeted by the news that he had rung wanting my head on a stick and forbidding me from ever setting foot on his farm again as all his tups had gone walkabout through the gate I'd left open. On advice from the partners at the practice who knew him better I gave him a day to calm down and then wrote a very grovelling letter! I was allowed to go back at the end of the week to read the test results (which fortunately was all clear). I think he's forgiven me.\n",
      "One of the more common cow operations we do is to correct a displaced stomach. In the two and a half years I've been at the practice we’ve always done it using one particular technique. There are circumstances where another method is indicated and having not seen them for 2½   years, there were 2 this week. They both went well (so far). Another two years before the next?\n",
      "I took my last day off for 2002 on Thursday and again spent it decorating. On Thursday night we had our Practice Christmas meal. The two vets on duty managed not to get called out and on the whole I think people weren't too hung over on Friday. Last year there was a bit of a debate as to whether we should have a Christmas night out as most farmers were either just starting to restock or still cleaning out. This year it was much more straightforward.\n",

It's made a pleasant change to have some company for a while. I have also acquired two stray kittens in the last week - the usual vet procedure of eventually finding an unwanted patient that you can't resist taking yourself. They are settling in ok and we’ve only had to have one or two little discussions about the benefits of using a litter tray rather than the carpet.\n",
      "The week at work has been reasonably busy - a good thing this week as there have been three students and it's a bit dull for them if there is nothing going on. We had a horse in for most of the week with a severe respiratory infection.  It’s needed fairly intensive care but seems to be on the mend now. I may use it as a case to write up as part of the exam I'm hoping to do in a few years. It'll have to be a New Year's resolution to get on with the writing up part of it.\n",

Monday was fairly quiet with just a few farm calls to do and some small animals. Rather worryingly we've heard that a local deer farm (not one of our customers) has gone down with TB, apparently with quite a few deer in the herd having it. This means that we'll have to do TB check tests on any of our farms that neighbour the affected premises.\n",

Most of it has been the usual sort of things for the time of year - cows starting to get lame after having been inside for a few months and metabolic problems, probably related to the poor silage last year's summer rain created. Quite a few farmers have a large amount of 2001 silage left as it wasn't used over winter 2001/2002 as they hadn't restocked. On the whole it's kept very well and in many cases is better than the crop they made last summer.\n",

I did the second one on Friday and will read it tomorrow (Monday). The farmers there are all very concerned about it which is understandable but hopefully groundless. There are lots of questions being asked along the lines of \"what if….” some of which I can answer and some not. It does remind me a bit of February 2001 when FMD broke out and there were all sorts of queries about the disease, its progression etc that none of  (us?) really knew about. It didn't take long for us to know the answers to most of them.\n",

      "The week had a bad start - the TB test I did last Friday produced two reactors and two inconclusive (borderline) reactors this means that the farm isn't allowed to move at any bovines on or off the farm except directly to slaughter under licence. The reactors are taken away for post-mortem examination and the inconclusive reactors are isolated for 60 days until the rest of the herd is re-tested. The farmer was very keen to get the inconclusive animals removed as well (quite understandably in my opinion) so that they couldn't pose a threat to the rest of his herd. Apparently DEFRA aren't allowed to do this, I think largely due to financial reasons. While fully appreciating the need to protect taxpayers' money, considering how much was spent in 2001 I think this a potentially flawed argument. Perhaps the rules need to be changed? But then again I'm not an epidemiologist and perhaps they don't actually pose a threat.\n",
      "The farmer seemed very depressed by it all. I think a lot of it is the feeling of having the stigma of being a farm under DEFRA restrictions again. He was also very aware of the threat he was to his neighbours and was desperately keen to minimise it. It's actually quite small while the cows are still indoors but I think people are still very much thinking of how serious it was for neighbours if someone got FMD. TB is a very different type of organism and it’s a question of getting people to understand this (which isn't to say it's not a very serious problem).\n",

Seeing as he's now confined to the practice doing small animals I've taken over couple of the farms he does routine fertility visits for.

The tests we've done are usually pretty sensitive but have failed to reveal any of the usual causes. Treatment seems to have been working in some cases but not in others. He hasn't lost any (i e none dead) but the loss in body weight is very obvious. It's all been a bit frustrating really. He's a very pleasant guy and hasn't said anything but when treatments repeatedly fail to get expected (and predicted) results I can't help feeling that he must be getting a bit sceptical about it. Or perhaps I'm just being paranoid! By the end of the week the majority seem to be on the mend but seeing as we haven't tracked down the causative agent it's hard to know what vaccination to recommend next year. There are some more tests that will come back in two weeks which may be more revealing.\n",
      "In midweek I did one of the fairly common operations to correct a twisted stomach in a cow. Surprisingly it was the first time this dairy farmer had had one done and he took some convincing that it was a good idea. Having persuaded someone to pay for a procedure I always feel under a bit more pressure than usual. Fortunately it went pretty well and the cow is, so far, doing well.\n",

And they do have long horns! Whilst trying to manoeuvre them into a crush to inject their necks with tuberculin we always had to be ready to take evasive action if they made a sudden turn. I don't think they ever tried to use their horns aggressively but they were so big that they become dangerous weapons when they were just moving normally. As it turned out no one received any injuries and, very importantly, the test was negative.\n",
      "This week also brought my first lambing of the year. Other people have done a few but this was my first. We have a couple of farms who lamb early for the early lamb sales - it seems very hard work at this time of year - but the early prices do seem to make it worthwhile. Give it another week or two and a sure they’ll start to become more frequent.\n",

We managed to make it to Waterloo station only to find the station in chaos as all Eurostars had been cancelled due to snow in France (at least it's not just Britain that can’t cope with it!) after being assured that none would run for 24 hours they suddenly told us to board, only 1½  hours late - very pleasant surprise.

      "Apparently last week was OK at work with no major dramas. We still haven't found any more TB cases but the screening continues all the time. One of the rules for re-stocking herds compared to herds that missed FMD is that all bovines over 42 days old have to be tested rather than just the adults. Last year when there weren't many calves around this didn't make much difference, but now most farms have at least a year's worth of calves in place it doubles the size of most tests. Often calves won't fit in crushes and are very wild so it can get quite exciting. It seems a necessary policy though - one of the reactors I found a few weeks ago was a six-month old stirk.\n",
      "I've had a fairly quiet week. I've had a couple of nights on duty which were both quiet. There's a horse near Carlisle that I think I've mentioned before with a recurrent tooth problem. We thought we'd finally sorted that but this week she developed a problem with one of the tendons on her foreleg. It's a bit disappointing for her owner as she only bought the horse recently in order to compete to a very high standard and she seems to () permanently off training with one ailment or another. I don't think it's too serious so hopefully in another week or two she'll be back to work.\n",

      "I found another positive TB case on Friday. I did the test on Tuesday on a very large beef herd on a restocking farm. Including calves they must have been just over 400 cattle to do. There was one reactor on Friday and two inconclusives. There is a possibility that it is a false positive - the farm has been having big problems with something called at Johne’s disease which is caused by a similar type of bacterium to the one that causes TB. There is a small possibility of a cow carrying Johne’s disease cross-reacting with the TB test injection. I actually blood sampled all the adult cows on Tuesday to screen the herd for Johne’s in order to try to start eradicating it from herd. It'll be interesting to see whether the positive test cow will be positive for Johne’s. Ultimately it doesn't really make much difference in the short term - the farm’s been placed under restrictions and the affected cow has been taken off for post mortem. One of my colleagues found another positive reactor on a different farm on Friday as well - that's three farms in the practice now and around 50 - 60 within Cumbria. The big worry now this is that the longer it stays around the more likely (inevitable?) it is disease will get into wildlife reservoirs - deer, and perhaps badgers depending on whether you believe that badgers are an influence or not. Time will tell, but I'm sure it's going to keep us busy for several years if not a lot more.\n",
      "I did a test on Monday as well on a small farm that I've never been to before - at least testing is one way of getting on to small farms who don't often need us. This one was all clear.\n",
      "The remainder of the week was spent doing more usual work. Lambing’s still not quite got into full swing although we are seeing a slow increase in the number of sheep been brought to the surgery.\n",

      "No TB testing for me this week and no more positive cases in the practice. The first case that I found back in January was confirmed as carrying TB this week though. Although it's bad news for the farmer it is quite reassuring to know that the tests and methods we use do detect carrier animals reasonably accurately.\n",
      "This week has been fairly busy without ever getting too hectic. I operated on a cow on Tuesday which for a number of reasons didn't go quite as smoothly as it might have done. It subsequently didn't do as well post-operatively as we would normally expect. The coming week should see an improvement (I hope). We can never give cast iron guarantees about the outcome of surgery but it is quite rare for this Op to fail, so fingers crossed for Monday. I had to see a horse with colic earlier in the week which on my first visit to I was very suspicious that it was going to require surgery to correct. The owner wasn't prepared for that happen though so it was a question of trying to manage it medically or euthanizing it. It wasn't in undue pain so we gave it a go medically, and much to my (pleasant) surprise over the next few hours and visits he did very well. (just goes to show we are not all-knowing!!!) It would have been interesting to know whether it was a surgical condition which somehow righted itself or whether it was a medical case all along which simply appeared as something more serious. I had to work for an hour or so on Saturday morning doing small animal consultations and then had the rest of the weekend off. We came second in a hockey match again and then I went up to Edinburgh to catch up with some college friends who haven't seen for a while.\n",

      "This week has really seen the start of the lambing season. The sheep every day or every other day that we've been seeing for the last month or so has turned into one every few hours during the day (and during the night in some cases). It’s encouraging that farmers are still bringing them in/calling us out as many feel that sheep aren't worth paying vet fees for. This obviously creates a welfare problem in many situations as inappropriate and inadequate treatment is sometimes provided by the farmer. Having said that I can see why some take the attitude of not spending money on them as prices are often so low.\n",
      "The other aspect of lambing time is that nights get very busy - on Monday I had a ewe caesarean at 2am, then a horse that had just foaled at 3.15.\n",
      "I had an hour or so in bed and then a sick cow at 6.20. Although it can be a bit tiring, on the whole cases we see out of hours are not the run-of-the-mill routine things so it does at least make it interesting (which isn't always the first thing on my mind when the phone rings at 3am!)\n",
      "Unfortunately the cow I operated on last week failed to improve and I had to re operate on Monday. This is far from ideal as it carries a much higher risk of infection than first-time operation. Somewhat to my surprise it seems to be doing very well now. Cows seem to be amazingly resilient if I'd had abdominal surgery twice in a mucky cow byre I'm sure I wouldn't cope as well.\n",
      "I did the same Op on a different farm later in the week which went much better. I’d be getting worried about my technique if two in a row went wrong.\n",
      "I've worked Saturday morning again supposedly just for an hour but it turned into about two-and-a-half as things kept coming in. I went up to Edinburgh again after hockey (came second again) to see someone who's left his job to go around the world for six months.\n",

      "The beginning of the week saw a visit to a horse, which had a chronic episode of laminitis (a hoof condition). In this horse's case it had become very severe and really beyond the point where treatment is feasible. Euthanasia was the best option for the horse as it was in a lot of pain. Unfortunately the owner was very reluctant for this and wanted to carry on with treatment. This sort of situation does crop up from time to time and is difficult for all concerned. In the end I told the owners what I thought the chances of recovery were and let them make their decision, which was to continue treatment. Hopefully I'll be proved wrong and the horse will recover, but I can't really see it happening. I saw another case later in the week which ended up going to Liverpool University for surgery. It was a small pony that had managed to cut itself very severely on barbed-wire (horses always find something to injure themselves on). There was a risk that it had penetrated a joint so I sent it to Liverpool to be flushed. As far as I know it's doing very well so far.\n",

      "I didn't leave the practice building until lunchtime on Saturday as there was a constant flow of small animals to see to and a few sheep brought in with lambing problems. I eventually left at 1.30 p m. to go to operate on a cow with a twisted stomach that was meant to be done at 11 am. The Op went a OK but it was then straight back to the surgery to do a caesarean on a whelping bitch with the help of a student who is seeing practice with us. Between then and 9 pm. It was a variety of sick cows, sheep to lamb and a calf with lead poisoning at the far end of Ullswater (would have been a very nice drive out if it hadn't been for the rush!). To top things off I had a cow caesarean at 9 pm.  It was very useful having a student to help all day - I think it was a bit of an eye opener for her!\n",
      "Sunday morning gave me to more Caesareans (sheep this time - variety is the spice of life), a cat who had very mysteriously lost a leg overnight (perhaps caught in a trap?) but was in incredibly good health otherwise - it's amazing what animals can withstand - and a good supply of other calls to keep me out of mischief. It has actually been quite enjoyable despite being so hectic, and (I think) most of the cases have been quite successful which always helps.\n",

      "Monday morning was the 60 day re-test for the first herd that I found TB in. It was a sunny day and on the whole the test went very smoothly. The farmer's buildings are getting very overcrowded though, as he is under a movement restriction due to the TB. First day started well as all the animals were giving negative readings, but then came the dreaded reaction to the injections we gave on the first day. There were four reactors in total; three of which were borderline and the other was very very obvious. The frustrating thing is that the obvious one was a borderline reactor last time but DEFRA refused to take it as it isn't in their policy to take inconclusive reactors found on a routine test. This means that an animal that is actually infected his left on premises to potentially infect other animals. The farmer had tried to point this out two months ago to no avail. He is now vindicated in his view, not that that is much consolation for the fact that his restrictions are to be continued and he may well (probably will in fact) now have more carriers which won't be found until the next Test in 60 days' time. The reason for not initially taking inconclusive reactors is to save money by not paying for the animals to be slaughtered that aren't actually infected. In cases like this it seems to be a real false economy and doesn't win DEFRA \n",

It's very easy to think of all the things you don't know but I think we've more or less managed to convince her that she does know enough not to be a liability when she qualifies!\n",
      "She saw an interesting incident on a call we did early in the week. I'd gone to replace a uterine prolapse in a cow, which went okay, but the farmer then asked me to falsely certify a cow. We can give certificates to cows over 30 months of age under the BSE scheme, for which farmers are compensated. This cow had to be put down, but wasn't 30 months for another four days. He was understandably \"quite upset\" about this and let me know! It’s this sort of thing that is a nightmare for anyone but especially someone just starting - you want to please the farmer and make a good impression, but you also have responsibility to not abuse your ability to use your signature. In the end I explained why he couldn't have a certificate and he did calm down. I'm sure Vicky will have similar situations before too long - diplomatic, as well as clinical, skills develop very quickly once in practice!\n",
      "Another interesting case came in on Thursday - a year old foal needed emergency surgery on a hernia. As luck would have it it was our first relatively quiet morning for a few weeks so we had enough vets on hand to do the surgery and anaesthetic. The Op went well and the horse has gone home this weekend.\n",
      "I've been on second call this weekend and things have been busy but not unmanageable. I did 2 Belgian Blue Caesareans in the space of six hours on one farm yesterday but since then it's just been a reasonable stream of calls rather than the madness of two weekends ago.\n",

Unfortunately the only way to firmly diagnose this is by post mortem, which is how most neurological cases end up and, alas, I fear this one will too.\n",
      "I went to do a fertility check at one of our dairy farms on Tuesday. The vet he normally has was away and he looked a bit put out when I turned up. I think (hope) I managed not to abort any of his cows and he seemed very cheery by the time I left. I suppose it's understandable that farmers tend to want continuity with which vet comes. Work continues to be very busy. An indication in the increase in daily workload is that we've had to introduce a specific messages book at work as there's no longer room to write people messages in the day book as it so full with appointments. They used to be a few days in the year when both pages of the day book were full (the first day of FMD in Penrith had one call) but this week 4 days have been full. It's got to be a good sign really and as I think I've said before, it does stop us all from getting bored!\n",

I accidentally brought us down a much more direct route than I intended so we had to while away some time in the garden of the Patterdale Hotel. Life's hard! Yesterday we left the bank holiday crowds in the lakes and went for a walk in the Eden Valley - didn't see a soul. It's amazing the difference a few miles can make. I suppose it hasn't got the hills and isn't as famous, but the scenery is still pretty impressive. But let's not tell anyone and then it might stay quiet on bank holidays….\n",

There were three of us on duty bracing ourselves for the usual spring onslaught and we only had about two calls each to do all morning. Weird how it sometimes turns out like that. Lambing is definitely quietening down now. The 5-10 lambings coming in each day is turning into 2-3. It's mostly fell sheep lambing now which tend to be easier to lamb so few are in need our/farmer’s assistance.\n",

We must be improving!\n",

On this occasion however it seems to have been a virulent strain and has caused a number of deaths and a great deal of lost production in terms of lost milk and calves not thriving. Towards the end of the week I went and shot three cows which were terminally affected. Seeing three dead and bleeding cows in the yard obviously reminded the farmer (and me) of when he had the whole herd shot in the same place for FMD, and he had then moved out of sight very quickly. I think the worst of the outbreak is over now and all the cows have been vaccinated.\n",
      "There's only one vet more junior/qualified for less time than me in the practice who started a year or so ago. This week we went to do a colt castrate together - one surgeon, one as anaesthetist - for the first time. We've both done a lot with other vets but this was the first time we've been let loose as a pair. Everything went very smoothly so it looks as though our boss's confidence/Trust wasn't totally misplaced. On Friday morning I had a big dehorning session for one of our beef farmers. It's fairly non-cerebral type work but is OK for a change every now and then. And the farmer is a pretty amenable sort of guy (more than could be said for the weather) so it was a fairly laid-back morning's work. I had the afternoon off and drove up to Edinburgh where there was a bit of a reunion for recent graduates from the vet college. There were a lot of people haven't seen for a long time and it was interesting to compare notes on what we were all up to.\n",

      "On Tuesday I did the 60 day re-test of the second herd of cattle that I had previously found a reactor in. It’s a big herd and it took all day to get it done. They’ve been a bit unfortunate and brought in several other diseases apart from the suspected TB, when they re-stocked. One of these, an enteric condition called Johnes disease, is a chronic wasting problem and is notoriously difficult to eradicate. It’ll take years  of blood-testing and careful record-keeping to get rid of it.\n",
      "It’s frustrating for them as all the planning for the post-FMD period has been disrupted. The TB test showed up no reactors this time but 3 cows were inconclusive results and will have to be re-tested. This is almost certainly as a result of the cows carrying antibodies to avian TB which causes no signs of disease in cows but disrupts the bovine TB test. It’s a good example of why we badly need a more specific method for testing for TB. It’s being worked on at the moment and hopefully we’ll get one one day.\n",
      "The senior partner at work is supervising another vet who is doing the same equine qualification that I’m enrolled for. On Wednesday he came to spend a day with Neil to do some equine anaesthetics. They were mainly castrates so I operated while Neil went through the anaesthetics with his student. It was very useful to hear it all in detail again – it’s all too easy to get into the habit of knowing which drugs work at what dosages and not actually really thinking about why they work or why they’re better than other drugs we could use. A useful day but it has made me realise I’ve got a lot to do over the next few years!\n",

It's too big a defect to stitch so it'll have to heal with a lot of bandaging and perhaps some skin grafts. It always amazes me how horses managed to give themselves the most horrendous injuries been fields where there really doesn't seem to be any opportunity for it. Clumsiness perhaps? Maybe they just enjoy pain (I doubt it).\n",

      "After a very pleasant weekend off I had a truly delightful first job on Monday morning. A cow had been losing weight for the last month also - the reason I found was that it had a very dead calf inside which I then spent the first hour of the week pulling out bone by bone. It was a fairly revolting job but wasn't actually something that I especially resented doing. Must mean I'm happy in my work. Or perhaps just a bit weird?\n",
      "I had another fairly grim job later in the week when I was called out at 4 a m. to a foaling. The foal was stuck half out and was dead by the time I got there. I eventually managed to get the foal out and initially the mare seemed OK but deteriorated over the next 48 hours and eventually had to be euthanased. That’s just the way it goes sometimes.\n",
      "A more successful case came later in the week when I saw a foal that was acutely lame. It looked at first as though it might have an infected elbow but after taking samples of the joint fluid and some X-rays it looked as though it was actually a traumatic injury. It stayed it in the hospital for four days during which time it seemed to improve quite a bit. It's a thoroughbred from a good racing line - hopefully with a rest it’ll make a full recovery and win the Grand National in 2008.\n",
      "I had the whole of the Bank Holiday weekend off. Six college friends came to stay for a weekend of Cumbrian fresh-air.

      "This week started with a TB test for a small re-stocking herd. He had bought some cattle from a farm that subsequently tested positive for TB. One of the cattle from that farm had then tested positive on his farm so this week's test was a 60 day re-test. It was an all-clear this time which was obviously a relief for them. Seeing as there was a positive on the farm last time they probably have to have another test in 60 days from now before restrictions are lifted. This farm isn't very big so being under TB restrictions is awkward but not as crippling as it is the larger farms. There is no room for relaxing the rules at the moment though. The recent news from Ireland that says they think they've proved a link with badgers makes it even more important to get it out of Cumbria before it gets into wildlife (although it may well already be too late).\n",

On Wednesday I spent most of the day touring around Cumbria seeing horses in Wigton, Cockermouth and Bassenthwaite.

I've done 2 cattle Caesareans on the same farm this weekend - one yesterday morning which seemed like a huge calf until the one I did this morning which was truly a freak. It was the biggest calf I or the farmer had seen and is the result of selecting for extreme confirmation in beef breeds. It does pose serious welfare issues for the cows as they cannot give birth naturally and have to have fairly major abdominal surgery instead. We’ll never persuade farmers of this though as the consumer wants cheaper food and cheaper beef is made through bigger beef calves. It does seem tough on the cows though. Or am I being too cynical?\n",

While a lot of the conversation was routed around the subjects you had come up with over the last 18 months, it often came back to talk of events and individual experiences during the outbreak itself. These stories must have been told on dozens of occasions but people still want to tell them if the right time/opportunity comes up (myself included).\n",
      "There were so many themes that you have all come up with on the \"electronic tags\" sheet that it seems impossible to comment on them all. Some of them seem very relevant to me, others not so much. Trust is a category that comes up under a couple of headings. One of the headings it is under is \"knowledge\". I think this has been one of the most significant changes since FMD as far as the farmer/vet relationship is concerned. DEFRA has gone from being eyed with some suspicion to overt distrust and resentment. On a whole we don't get too much flack as veterinary GPs but when we have to do DEFRA allocated jobs, such as TB testing, there is sometimes a general feeling of it being another task to try to wear them down being sent by the authorities. Another regulation that has caused huge resentment is the whole animal movement licensing system. It is much easier now and causes fewer problems but a year or so ago it was the source of much stress. We had to try to act as intermediary between farmers and DEFRA and keep both sides happy. The damage done to the farmer/DEFRA Trust will take a long time (if ever) to start to repair. Hopefully, by trying to be more \"on their side\" than DEFRA seem to be, the trust they have in us has been preserved.\n",

      "One of our big dairy farmers was away in Thailand this week. The farm was left to be run by his usual workers and his brother and mother. Despite this he felt he had to take his mobile phone with him, and he was rung twice during the week to be asked what should be done with a couple of sick cows. I suppose this either demonstrates extreme dedication or an inability to forget about work. Or both. But then again it also shows how committed a lot of farmers are and that it's not just a job to them. As farms get bigger the concept of all the cows being individually known to the farmer or being his \"friends\" becomes increasingly unrealistic, but in the majority of cases they’re not just milk making machines and are cared for pretty well. It's not hard to see why it was so hard for people to lose their herds.\n",

After meeting up with the boat and the rest of the group in Starigrad we sailed to Vis into a fairly direct head wind so it took quite a bit of tacking and was a bit of a rough ride. I also very stupidly underdid the sunscreen and managed to burn my back. Very careless, but it got less uncomfortable as the week went on. We spent two nights in Vis harbour as the others who had already been sailing for a week wanted a rest. It used to be a military island and there were definite signs of this around although it is obviously developing a now rapidly-growing tourist trade. After Vis it was off to Hvar, where we anchored in a small inlet a few miles from the town. After a night there we went to Hvar town for a look around - the castle on the hill was very impressive and the town still feels as though it is relatively unspoilt at the moment.\n",

It was the first time I'd been there in three and a half years of working here - so they don't make huge use of our veterinary services. One of their bullocks was 7½  years old! When I casually asked about what plans they had for it seeing as he had missed the 30 months cut-off time for human consumption I was told it was just kept as a friend for the bull! The test was very slow as the cattle handling facilities were not the best on the planet. They were very pleasant people to talk to and it soon became apparent that they had very little time for DEFRA (nothing unusual there). The son was one of the people who had had his firearms confiscated after making threats at the start of FM D.  They still felt resentful about the way the police became involved and the way they were ultimately given no choice as to who came on to their farm to check their stock. Fortunately all the cattle were negative for TB so there was no need to further add to their distrust of DEFRA by putting them under more restriction.\n",

We went from Penrith to Alston to Barnard Castle, to Tan Hill (refreshments) to Kirkby-Stephen to Penrith on Saturday. And then recovered on Sunday. It seemed like a good idea at the time but I am really feeling it now!\n",

      "Looking back at some of the quotes in the \"Recovery\" section of the notes from a meeting it's noticeable how easy it is to forget (or at least not have in one's mind) how much it affected a lot people. It's almost hard to remember how much I was affected by it - I know that there were some very unpleasant tasks such as supervising slaughters, and day-to-day work was often very frustrating when we felt people overseeing our work from offices didn't really know what it was like in the field, but I feel now that on the whole once work was finished life pretty much went on. Maybe this isn't actually a true reflection of how it was and it's just that some of the detailed memories are fading - often things don't seem as bad as they actually were when you look back on them. I know plenty of clients, colleagues and friends whose lives were completely overtaken by FMD so perhaps mine was more than I remember, but I also feel that most of the people who I remember as being heavily affected are now more-or-less completely over it. \n",
      "One of the farms I went to this week lost a son in a road accident about two months after getting FMD. I think the farmer was ready to give up everything after that. Apparently he left the cleaning up of his farm and took no interest in anything. Time obviously helped him - he's been back milking again for that (sic) last year and a half. There are still changes though - he seems very much quieter and more laid back now. If a cow isn't in calf or things don't go quite right he doesn't seem to get stressed now, as he once would have done. Work has been a bit quieter this week, which we would expect at this time of year. One of our farms has put some pedigree Belgian blue embryos into some Limousin cross heifers and they're starting to calve now - they all need Caesar's as the calves are almost as big as the heifers that produce them. The only thing to be said for it is that we can do them at a sensible time of day rather than at two in the morning as we know when they’re due.\n",

      "One of the five categories you raised at the meetings last month was trauma and one of the subsections on the chart was \"sounds/smells/visions\". Sights are probably the most frequent reminder of FMD now - there are certain bits of road that have memories, for example driving north on the M6 just south of Penrith it was possible to count smoke plumes from about 20 pyres at one stage. On fine days it always reminds me of it when I drive that stretch. One farm has the remains of a pyre that was started to be built but never finished. Even things like driving across two lines of tar across a road which once held down a disinfectant mat. People who didn't live here at the time wouldn't even notice them but it seems quite significant to the rest of us. It doesn't really bother me, but just is a reminder of what went on. At other times it seems odd how quickly things have gone back to normal. - even something as simple as a road with mud or animal muck on it. In 2001 that would have stuck out like a sore thumb and would have warranted urgent action.  Now I'm used to driving a dirty car (I do clean it sometimes) and having some roads caked in dirt. It's difficult to imagine how the farmers kept them clean two years ago. (But they did). \n",
      "Obviously there are other reminders (people never tire of talking about it), but it's the day-to-day visions and places that are most regular.\n",
      "Work has been a bit quieter this week. I did it a Caesar on a cow which had a truly ridiculously enormous calf. We need to move away from breeding continental beef breeds and go back to nice compact Jersey's or Aberdeen Anguses! I also saw an unusual neurological case in a horse. It's very uncoordinated and has poor balance. It's the kind of case where brain/spinal scan would be useful, but those facilities aren't really available for horses! It will be interesting to see how it goes over the next few days. \n",

      "Diary 71\n",
      "The last diary! The 18 months seem to have gone by quickly. Things seem so much back to how they were that it's odd to think back to what was going on when we first started writing them. I think we were pretty much in the swing of doing restocking checks and doing endless blood sampling of sheep. The last restocking checks I did were only 16 months ago - it seems far longer. Although I say things are back to how they were I'm sure there are actually a lot of differences, it's just that I don't notice them because I'm used to how things are now. The practice has become a lot busier. By October we’ll be up to nine full-time and two part-time vets. Pre FMD we were seven full-time and two part-time. Some of the increase is Equine and small animal, but most of it is in farm practice. Part of this is directly linked to FMD (eg more TB testing due to re-stocking tests, and re-stocking having brought TB into the county). Other factors aren't so obvious but are unquestionably FMD related - most restocked farmers went back with more stock than they originally had, so overall there is greater density of stock around. More animals means more sick animals which means more calls for the vet. It's a shame in some ways to see the small traditional farms being forced out, but it's hard to see how they can manage as margins get smaller and larger neighbours get more stock and more land. FMD was a way out for several of the smaller farms - all have been bought up by neighbours with none being sold as single units. \n",
      "As I've said in recent weeks, this time of year is usually quiet - it has become a bit less frantic recently but the traditional summer lull hasn't materialised. \n",
      "I've been a vet for four years. The last three have been just about as interesting and challenging as they could have been - both professionally and socially from the point of view of living in Penrith. Obviously FMD had devastating effects on thousands of people, many of whom are my friends. On the whole I see very few residual scars - it  is still talked about, but less and less as time goes on. More than one farmer has actually said that they think in hindsight it was a very good thing for them. I'm not sure I could ever say that as it brought too much stress and sadness for too many people, but if it had happened, I think (very much with the benefit of hindsight) I’m glad that I had the chance to be involved with it from the start and through the recovery.\n",
