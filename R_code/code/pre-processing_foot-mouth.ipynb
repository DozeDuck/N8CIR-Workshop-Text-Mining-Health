Usual chat and DEFRA comments\\nThe meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus. Farmers seem far more upset at the constriction put on them by DEFRA than they do by the loss of stock now, although I know and saw how utterly devastated most were when ...  \n",

I accept that I have to put in 10 – 12 hours and I don’t mind doing the work because it’s not physically or mentally taxing but I do hate not having a lunch break, just that little bit of selfish time to site, have a cigarette, take the dogs down the river, see the horses…whatever. I do resent that fact that W (one of the bosses) almost always gets a lunch hour. B (the other boss) has gone up tremendously in my opinion for the way that he gets on with the work. He starts early, finishes late, hates DERFA paperwork and rarely complains. It is definitely grinding them down because they work like that at least 4 days a week. It has been a huge advantage this last year being part-time at work. My days off obviously aren’t my own as they used to be, but I do get away from the phone and the demands of clients.

The judge had acquitted her of the offences, he showed leniency towards her. Last year during the FMD crisis she had returned to her home to find that her pet goat had been killed by slaughterers because the animal was within the 3 km radius. She had gone berserk over this and threatened the Police Officer and others with the knife.

A farmer who has restocked has had to have an animal or animals destroyed because of T.B. is there no justice at all. My friend who did not go down with F &amp; M but had to loose all his sheep through the culling system, amongst them were pedigree Leicesters of quite renowned breeding. Consequently he made more crop because he did not have enough livestock to eat his crop.\\n\\nTuesday back into work after my rest days. The merry-go-round continues, more farms coming back after F &amp; M.

Usual chat and DEFRA comments\\nThe meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus.

A young lady had just left a court where she had been found guilty of assaulting a Police Officer and also being in change of an offensive weapon -–a knife. The judge had acquitted her of the offences, he showed leniency towards her. Last year during the FMD crisis she had returned to her home to find that her pet goat had been killed by slaughterers because the animal was within the 3 km radius. She had gone berserk over this and threatened the Police Officer and others with the knife. She had to be forcibly restrained, she was very distraught over this killing.\\nEven after she had appeared in court and had been acquitted of all charges she showed great emotion not only being freed but also quite upset over the los...</td>\n",

Usual chat and DEFRA comments\\nThe meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus. Farmers seem far more upset at the constriction put on them by DEFRA than they do by the loss of stock now, although I know and saw how utterly devastated most were when ...   \n",

I do resent that fact that W (one of the bosses) almost always gets a lunch hour. B (the other boss) has gone up tremendously in my opinion for the way that he gets on with the work. He starts early, finishes late, hates DERFA paperwork and rarely complains. It is definitely grinding them down because they work like that at least 4 days a week.

Usual chat and DEFRA comments\\nThe meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus. Farmers seem far more upset at the constriction put on them by DEFRA than they do by the loss of stock now, although I know and saw how utterly devastated most were when ...</td>\n",

I accept that I have to put in 10 – 12 hours and I don’t mind doing the work because it’s not physically or mentally taxing but I do hate not having a lunch break, just that little bit of selfish time to site, have a cigarette, take the dogs down the river, see the horses…whatever. I do resent that fact that W (one of the bosses) almost always gets a lunch hour. B (the other boss) has gone up tremendously in my opinion for the way that he gets on with the work. He starts early, finishes late, hates DERFA paperwork and rarely complains. It is definitely grinding them down because they work like that at least 4 days a week. It has been a huge advantage this last year being part-time at work. My days off obviously aren’t my own as they used to be, but I do get away from the phone and the demands of clients.

The judge had acquitted her of the offences, he showed leniency towards her. Last year during the FMD crisis she had returned to her home to find that her pet goat had been killed by slaughterers because the animal was within the 3 km radius. She had gone berserk over this and threatened the Police Officer and others with the knife.

Usual chat and DEFRA comments\\nThe meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus. Farmers seem far more upset at the constriction put on them by DEFRA than they do by the loss of stock now, although I know and saw how utterly devastated most were when ...   \n",

I do resent that fact that W (one of the bosses) almost always gets a lunch hour. B (the other boss) has gone up tremendously in my opinion for the way that he gets on with the work. He starts early, finishes late, hates DERFA paperwork and rarely complains. It is definitely grinding them down because they work like that at least 4 days a week. It has been a huge advantage this last year being part-time at work. My days off obviously aren’t my own as they used to be, but I do get away from the phone and the demands of clients.

Usual chat and DEFRA comments\\nThe meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus.

I do resent that fact that W (one of the bosses) almost always gets a lunch hour. B (the other boss) has gone up tremendously in my opinion for the way that he gets on with the work. He starts early, finishes late, hates DERFA paperwork and rarely complains. It is definitely grinding them down because they work like that at least 4 days a week.

A farmer who has restocked has had to have an animal or animals destroyed because of T.B. is there no justice at all. My friend who did not go down with F &amp; M but had to loose all his sheep through the culling system, amongst them were pedigree Leicesters of quite renowned breeding. Consequently he made more crop because he did not have enough livestock to eat his crop.\\n\\nTuesday back into work after my rest days. The merry-go-round continues, more farms coming back after F &amp; M. This is good as it helps to secure everyone’s jobs at the depot but it also causes problems as I have to start and change loads round again.

Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus. Farmers seem far more upset at the constriction put on them by DEFRA than they do by the loss of stock now, although I know and saw how utterly devastated most were when ...   \n",

I accept that I have to put in 10 – 12 hours and I don’t mind doing the work because it’s not physically or mentally taxing but I do hate not having a lunch break, just that little bit of selfish time to site, have a cigarette, take the dogs down the river, see the horses…whatever. I do resent that fact that W (one of the bosses) almost always gets a lunch hour. B (the other boss) has gone up tremendously in my opinion for the way that he gets on with the work. He starts early, finishes late, hates DERFA paperwork and rarely complains. It is definitely grinding them down because they work like that at least 4 days a week. It has been a huge advantage this last year being part-time at work. My days off obviously aren’t my own as they used to be, but I do get away from the phone and the demands of clients.

Usual chat and DEFRA comments\\nThe meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus. Farmers seem far more upset at the constriction put on them by DEFRA than they do by the loss of stock now, although I know and saw how utterly devastated most were when ...</td>\n",

I accept that I have to put in 10 – 12 hours and I don’t mind doing the work because it’s not physically or mentally taxing but I do hate not having a lunch break, just that little bit of selfish time to site, have a cigarette, take the dogs down the river, see the horses…whatever. I do resent that fact that W (one of the bosses) almost always gets a lunch hour. B (the other boss) has gone up tremendously in my opinion for the way that he gets on with the work. He starts early, finishes late, hates DERFA paperwork and rarely complains. It is definitely grinding them down because they work like that at least 4 days a week.

Usual chat and DEFRA comments\\nThe meeting (research panel gp 6) at the North Lakes was interesting. It surprises me sometimes how people (myself included) never seem to tire of the same stories and complaints over how the crisis was handled. Some of the episodes recounted must have been told dozens of times over the last year but whoever says it always seems just as keen to say it again – Perhaps a reflection of how deeply people feel about the events of the last year. Having said that, most of the resentments and rants that I hear on daily farm visits are focused fairly and squarely at DEFRA and not FMD virus.

We are just relieved that we don't have to disinfect everything between every farm and every time we wash things, it is a little worrying as all the disinfectant seems to be bringing the paint off the wheels on the tractors and the machines.  That at least is going to be a lasting reminder of what we were doing in 2001.\\n\\nWeek 2\\nFirst part of the week was fairly normal, not a lot to comment on.

A farmer who has restocked has had to have an animal or animals destroyed because of T.B. is there no justice at all. My friend who did not go down with F & M but had to loose all his sheep through the culling system, amongst them were pedigree Leicesters of quite renowned breeding. Consequently he made more crop because he did not have enough livestock to eat his crop.\\n\\nTuesday back into work after my rest days. The merry-go-round continues, more farms coming back after F & M. This is good as it helps to secure everyone’s jobs at the depot but it also causes problems as I have to start and change loads round again.

The judge had acquitted her of the offences, he showed leniency towards her. Last year during the FMD crisis she had returned to her home to find that her pet goat had been killed by slaughterers because the animal was within the 3 km radius. She had gone berserk over this and threatened the Police Officer and others with the knife.

When it actually hit our area and local farms, people you knew, actually had foot and mouth you were sort of numb, numb with shock, really.

When it actually hit our area and local farms, people you knew, actually had foot and mouth you were sort of numb, numb with shock, really.  Hearing about them, people that you knew and their livelihood gone.  Obviously, us local people here having had no immediate connection with farming, we felt for the farmers.

When it actually hit our area and local farms, people you knew, actually had foot and mouth you were sort of numb, numb with shock, really.

A young lady had just left a court where she had been found guilty of assaulting a Police Officer and also being in change of an offensive weapon -–a knife. The judge had acquitted her of the offences, he showed leniency towards her. Last year during the FMD crisis she had returned to her home to find that her pet goat had been killed by slaughterers because the animal was within the 3 km radius. She had gone berserk over this and threatened the Police Officer and others with the knife. She had to be forcibly restrained, she was very distraught over this killing.\\nEven after she had appeared in court and had been acquitted of all charges she showed great emotion not only being freed but also quite upset over the los...   \n",
