<b>Data Archive Processing Standards</b>



<p/>The data were processed to the UK Data Archive's A standard. A rigorous and 
comprehensive series of checks was carried out to ensure the quality of the data 
and documentation.Firstly, checks were made that the number of cases and 
variables matched the depositor's records. Secondly, checks were made that all 
variables had variable labels and all nominal (categorical) variables had value 
labels. Where possible, either with reference to the documentation and/or in 
communication with the depositor, absent labels were created. Thirdly, logical 
checks were performed to ensure that nominal (categorical) variables had values 
within the range defined (either by value labels or in the depositor's 
documentation). Lastly, any data or documentation that breached confidentiality 
rules were altered or suppressed to preserve anonymity.

<p/>All notable and/or outstanding problems discovered are detailed under the 'Data 
and documentation problems' heading below. 






<br /><br /><b>Data and documentation problems</b>
<p/>No significant problems encountered.




<br /><br /><b>Conversion of documentation formats</b> 
<p/>Electronic and paper documentation supplied with this study is usually 
	incorporated into the UKDA User Guide (in PDF format). The conversion programmes 
	used are the latest versions of Adobe PDF Writer for electronic documentation 
	and Adobe Paper Capture (Acrobat 'plugin' version) for paper documentation. 
	Occasionally, someof the electronic documentation cannot be usefully converted 
	to PDF (e.g. MS Excel files with wide worksheets) and this is supplied ina more 
	appropriate format. All User Guides are fully bookmarked.
