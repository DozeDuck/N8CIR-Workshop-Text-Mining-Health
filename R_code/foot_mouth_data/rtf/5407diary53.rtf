\par 
\par Thurs 17}{\super\insrsid5454774 th}{\insrsid5454774 .  Stephen came at 7.00am to drill the last grain at Spring Kell.  I followed him round with slug pellets so as }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  could ta
ke the applicator back to Blakes on her way to work.  After lunch we injected the calves out of the shed with pneumonia vaccine as well as a pour on wormer.  Did the bull as well.  Went up to Haile afterwards and dosed for worms and vitamins all the lambs
 from the field next to house and put into Greens fields.

  Had a good crack at evening with a Tunisian receptionist chap who knew a lot about agriculture.  He was asking if our cows in England had got rid of all their diseases he thought we had too many cows, they all lived too close together and that was why d

\par 
\par Tuesday.  Cannot beat these good cooked breakfasts.  Visited a lot
 of smaller stands today, probably better crack.  We could not do this yesterday when there was 3 of us.  Thomas and I also split up most of the day which probably helped.  You can do this now a days with mobile phones to contact each other again.  20 yea

\par 
\par Tuesday.  Dosed all the cows at Haile with combinex fluke and worm drench.  Brought 80 home and put in far end of }{\insrsid9269329 poly tunnel}{\insrsid5454774

\par 
\par Wednesday.  Done up with Toddy this morning then he lad some muck o
nto Guards Park and I went to Cockermouth Auction.  Christmas Fat Cattle show and sale.  It was an excellent turn out and even a buzz in the air, but maybe not quite as exciting as 20 years ago or is it just that we are not quite as easy to please now.  C
omputer class at night.
\par 
\par Thursday.  Done up with Toddy then he crushed and had an early finish.  I went to High Monthorpe Experimental Farm near Malton in North Yorkshire for an organic beef and sheep meeting and farm walk.  Interesting crack, good to see h

\par Friday.  Sorted and tagged 50 lambs and took to Cockermouth.  Probably the best trade yet.  Had a local farmer primed up to buy them, which worked well.  I just hope they do well enough for him
.  Toddy put fresh bales of straw in feed passage then went off.  He will spend a lot of time from now until Christmas sorting and selling Christmas trees.  Him and two mates do it among them and have quite a good reputation for them.  Got my BCMS CTS use
r ID and password today.
\par 
\par Saturday.  Just seemed to do up and feed sheep all day.  Went to Boonwood Hotel at night with family and staff - }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774 , Toddy and Daphne for a steak.  Good feed, quiet pub but good crack among ourselves.
\par 
\par Sunday.  Quiet easy day, girls messed with horses all afternoon.  Neither }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  or me seemed to do much at all.

\par }{\b\insrsid5454774 Week 51
\par }{\insrsid5454774 Monday.  Toddy off all day so I had to get my finger out.  Done up quickly then went to Scandith to lead chicken muck out.  There was only 3 loads, the rest had gone to the power station.  Called in at Allan Telford}{\insrsid2063073 
\rquote }{\insrsid5454774 s for coffee before coming home.  Put silage round all the ewes at afternoon. 
\par 
\par Tuesday.  Hired JCB.  Spent the day levelling the paddock up with it in preparation for the concreting the first half and the loading area next to the cattle race.  Toddy just worked till 11am basically just to feed up.
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Toddy had a full day leading muck out of the yard onto Guards Park.  I spent most of the day putting shuttering in the loading alley in preparation for concreting.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 
 to spend the night at Penrith while her car gets a new alternator belt fitted.  So I had a NSA AGM to go to at Penrith.  Picked her up at Newton Rigg took her to the meeting then dropped her off before coming home.
\par 
\par Thurs
day.  Load of ready mixed concrete at morning.  Seemed to go down well.  Put silage round all the sheep again.  Its good frosty weather and it does help to learn these ewes how to eat silage in large quantities.  Tagged 50 lambs up for tomorrow.  Scraped 
out at night after the yards had thawed and put fresh straw bales in the feed passage.  Went to my computer class at night after going to Eskdale with }{\insrsid5443691 E}{\insrsid5454774 , they\rquote 
ve roped me into a Pony Club target shooting competition.  Something different that I am not bad at.
\par 
\par Friday.  Took my 50 lambs to Carlisle.  Probably the worst trade I\rquote ve had all back end.  There was a definite lack of buyers, also the lambs are getting less in size and quantity.  Went on to collect a gate from John Ackerley}{\insrsid4874800 
\rquote }{\insrsid5454774 s at Milton near Brampton.  I\rquote ve known this chap for a long time and he makes a good wooden gate.  The gate is for an electrician who is doing our electrics up at the farm in exchange.
\par 
\par Saturday.  Load of concrete at morning.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  helped me to lay it then went driving at 11am.  Put silage all round for ewes afternoon then scraped out.  Brought 2 lean cows out of outside house and put in a box.  }{
\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 , the girls and myself went to the Pony Club Xmas party and presentation night.  Then at 11pm we left the girls with Helen at that do and went to Tyson Norman\rquote 
s Silver Wedding Party at his house.  It coincided with his daughters 18}{\super\insrsid5454774 th}{\insrsid5454774  Birthday and his eldest daughters return from teaching in Zimbabwe.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 
 suggested went home at 2am.  It was probably a good idea too.   
\par 
\par Sunday.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  here at morning helped to feed up.  Andrew Topaz came for a load of straw.  I spent the afternoon cleaning the gutter out in the front field while the JCB was here.
\par 
\par 
\par }{\b\insrsid5454774 Week 52
\par }{\insrsid5454774 Monday.  Put a load of concrete down in paddock.  It was raining a bit hard fo
r the job and made it sandy on top.  Not happy with it but suppose its better than frost, once it gets covered in FYM no-one will notice.  Took two bales of silage to Martin Park for the ewes, sorry of this gets a bit repetitive but honestly most of my li
fe is taken up at present feeding cows and sheep and cleaning the muck up after them.  }{\insrsid5443691 [daughter?]}{\insrsid5454774  on holiday from school may as well been there as she stayed in bed till 2pm. 
\par 
\par Tuesday.  Scraped out at morning and done up then put silage out for ewes at Haile, gave tups}{\cs19\super\insrsid2063073 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s20\ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0

 a bale as well.  Tony Beattie here today cutting roadside hedges at Mill House.  This is a compromise between cutting hedges and leaving them alone.  I purposely leave them till now, don\rquote t cut the grass back too much and don\rquote 
t top the hedge.  Its more of a safety \'85 than anything and at least the neighbours can\rquote t say I haven\rquote 
t done it but in all fairness I think my hedges look a lot better than a lot of my neighbours that are topped annually and have no young vegetation in the bottom of the hedge.  Its called being environmentally friendly.
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Put load of concrete in paddock.  Too frosty this time, couldn\rquote t get it right.  Started cows on silage today, they\rquote ve been on straw till now but we\rquote ve done enough now and I think the silage will last, although I\rquote 
ve plenty of straw left.  I think straw will sell better than silage and the cows will feed better.  Young Farmers Xmas social at night.  Goodnight enjoyed by all.
\par 
\par Thursday.  Done up at morning myself then Thomas came rou
nd to say he was going to Carlisle machinery sale then coming home via Kirkbride for some protein mix in 1/2 tonne bags and did I fancy a ride out.  So as I had a slight bad head from the night before I accepted the invitation.  Enjoyed the day thoroughly
 and bought a little trailer to fit behind the Land Rover with sides, tail gate, lights, brakes, the lot for \'a3200 delivered home as well.  I\rquote ve been looking for one for a while but maybe for something bigger and better but it\rquote 
s the right price and it was off a customer of mine that buys straw off me.
\par 
\par Friday. Toddy here till lunchtime then that\rquote s it till after the New Year.  Crushed enough barley and oats to last over the holidays.  He brought a Christmas tree down and fitted in a block and sprayed to reduce
 pine needle drop.  It saved me nicking one out of the forestry.  I put silage round at Guards and Haile.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  went for }{\insrsid7282067 G}{\insrsid5454774  after lunch.  }{\insrsid5443691 E}{\insrsid5454774 
\rquote s last day of school.  Peace has ended for a couple of weeks.
\par 
\par Saturday.  Nice dry morning.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  helped 
me to feed up then I went and brought Martin Parks ewes down home to dose them with combinex to combat fluke and worms.  Kept 6 thin ewes down and took the tups out of them to take to Haile and took the rest back up.
\par 
\par Sunday.  Put the horses in the paddock today on the NEW concrete.  They\rquote ve got part of a barn to shelter in and the feeder and the water trough are on the new concrete.  Hopefully they won\rquote 
t make a mess and will be better on their feet.  Its cost about \'a32000 to concrete it but it looks a lot better and will be handy when working among sheep in the pens.  And if someday we haven\rquote 
t as many horses the area would winter about 30 cattle.  This must be 12 months of these diaries, maybe hasn\rquote t been that bad.

Monday.  Had another load of concrete ordered for this morning but cancelled it at 8am.  Reasons -no-one to help with it, it was raining, I had plenty to do without it.  It rained all day, the muck in the yards is awash and will not stack up.
\par 
\par Tuesday.  The big day is getting nearer.  Try to do everything today, plenty silage round for the all the sheep, bedding straw in for the cattle, good scrape out, though left that till night then I wouldn\rquote 
t have to do it tomorrow.  Took 3 loads of straw out to 3 farmers who needed it to get over Xmas.  Took }{\insrsid7282067 G}{\insrsid5454774  to Harry\rquote 
s for 2 hours at night.  Sent to J Parks to deliver presents at 11pm had 2 hours good crack.  Went to bed and slept tight in}{\insrsid4874800  }{\insrsid5454774 case Santa Claus caught me awake.
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Merry Christmas.  Done up nicely.  Was not raining, well not hard anyways.  When I got finished T}{\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774  had come down with presents so had a drink with him then we all went on our annual visit to J}{
\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774 and AG\rquote s to eat all their nice pies, sausage rolls and drink quite a lot of mulled wine etc. as well as have a good crack and wish them seasons greetings.  But this year was different, }{\insrsid7282067 G}{
\insrsid5454774  had bought me a Santa Claus kit to wear for the day.  Got back 2.30 had a good dinner, felt like the turkey looked before we started it.  Suggested at 4.30 that I was going for a walk so }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 
 came with me for a walk round about 4 stubble fields, and then had tea.
\par 
\par Thursday.  No rest for the wicked.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  helped me to do up but the Nuffield injector pump packed in half way through scraping
 out.  Then I had that much sloppy muck on the yards I had to spend most of the day spreading muck.  Just put it in the field across the road so as not to disturb the village.  Went at night to visit my sister Rose and Barry then to see parents and exchan
ge presents as well.
\par 
\par Friday.  Done up at morning and then came in the house, had a bit crack with Pony Club lot, they were having a mock hunt here then escaped and brought all the ewes from Haile to the Corner Field.  When I\rquote d finished I moved the rest of 
the straw over out of }{\insrsid9269329 poly tunnel}{\insrsid5454774  into the barn, about 80 bales.  It wasn\rquote t too bad a job got the radio tuned in well.
\par 
\par Saturday.  Tom Kerr coming to scan the ewes today at 10am.  Got done up early and brought 1}{\super\insrsid5454774 st}{\insrsid5454774  lot of sheep down ready for starting.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 
 and the girls went up for a bigger lot.  Got a bit dark before we finished sorting but got them all back before night except the geld ones.  Scanned nicely except from the fact there was 65 he would not commit himself they were either too far off lambi
ng or geld so he is going to come back in a months time and do those again.  I will put a tup with them now,  if there\rquote s 25 in-lamb and I get another 25 in-lamb it won\rquote t look so bad if there is only 15 geld\'85
 out of 442.  Went to party at Eddies Simell}{\insrsid10552219 \rquote }{\insrsid5454774 s at night, called at D Hopes on way home.
\par

 and the girls at the bungalow.  The last tenants left before Xmas and she\rquote s going to let it furnished so they are putting a load of flat pack furniture together.
\par

\par }{\b\insrsid5454774 Week 54
\par }{\insrsid5454774 Monday.  Had a lot of rain yesterday.  The yard was awash with slurry so had to lead some of it out into the middle field.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 , the girls and }{\insrsid7282067 G}{\insrsid5454774  and
 Adam went to the pictures so I get a quiet night in the house.
\par 
\par Tuesday.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  here all day helping me.  Took silage out for all the ewes, emptied silage out of cattle feed passage into ring feeders and replaced with fresh bales then it is not to do tomorrow
.  Wilson came down to have a look at Nuffield with us found that the near bearing on the injector pump was knackered so we took the pump off and he dropped it off at Seaton at a retired expert recommended by another expert.  They phoned back to say it wo
uld cost \'a3350 I could only say OK.  I spent a couple of hours cleaning septic tanks out.  At night the }{\insrsid8864230 [friends]}{\insrsid5454774  met at the Ratty Arms in \'85 for a meal then went back to \'85
 to see the New Year in.  kids watching a video.  Adul
ts having crack in the kitchen.  I remember on the Millennium New Year a neighbouring farmer wishing me Happy New Year and saying 1999 had been a bad year and 2000 could only be better, little did we know that was just the start of it. 
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Nice pleasant morning doing up.  Got finished.  Had a cup of tea and went to Sandwith to have a good walk round.  Haven\rquote t really been there since we finished drilling in mid-October.  Bad crack when you have a 160 acre farm and haven
\rquote t been for 2 1/2 months.  But all seems well apart from 15 acres of \'85
 does not seem to have grown.  It got the same chance as the other crops of 120 acres of wheat and oats, must have been bad seed.  Came home about 4pm had 2 hours on the chair (asleep) then had tea and went to the p
ub.  Good night enjoyed by all.  Home at 2am and slept like a baby.
\par 
\par Thursday.  Remarkable clear head under the circumstances.  Thomas came to compare notes at 9.30, he was OK too.  Rained a heck of a lot at morning, water everywhere.  Could not get the su
bmersible pump working on the dirty water system.  Had to buy a new smaller pump at Egremont for \'a3
80 (which was not bad) to pump half the water out then I could get the main pump out and clean it and get it working again.  By then it was 6pm and I was back
 to where I was at 8am.  Never mind all in a days work.  Complained to Furness and South Cumbria Supply Association about Trilicale seed, suggested I wanted another tonne of seed. 
\par 
\par Friday.  A dry day, what a difference.  Spread all the muck out of the yard on Ashlea Bottom.  You should not wish your life away but I wish it was next week and Toddy was back doing some of these jobs and give me a break.
\par 
\par Saturday.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  here most of the day, done up and took silage to sheep at Guards.  Went up to Haile and had a good crack with }{\insrsid4277611 C}{\insrsid5454774 .  Tucker Dixon came for a load of straw.  }{
\insrsid8864230 CP }{\insrsid5454774  phoned to say they were having a party.  It seemed rude to decline the offer and enjoyed the night.  
\par 
\par Sunday.  Done up OK.  Neil Fowler came for straw.  I went to Grahams for a load of potatoes just in time for lunch.
\par 
\par 
\par }{\b\insrsid5454774 Week 55
\par }{\insrsid5454774 Monday.  Thank-God for that, holidays are over and Toddy is back.  I helped him do up at morning then kicked about with }{\insrsid7282067 G}{\insrsid5454774  till 1pm when I had to take him to Junction 37 to meet }{\insrsid14746834 
[wife]}{\insrsid5454774  who had been to Penrith and was on her way to Truro for 3 days so she was dropping off }{\insrsid7282067 G}{\insrsid5454774  at David Lewis Centre school on the way down.  Toddy took a load of straw to Fle
mming Hall then brought a load of biscuit meal from }{\insrsid2308136 TN}{\insrsid5454774 s home because he had to muck them then he took a load of straw to \'85.   Had a quiet nigh everybody away even }{\insrsid5443691 E}{\insrsid5454774  \'85
 herself out at \'85 for the night.
\par 
\par Tuesday.  Brought 2 loads of silage from Haile to use for cows.  Its last year silage and its not good enough to give to the sheep so we\rquote d better use it up and leave the better stuff for the sheep.  Spent all afternoon and evening \'85
 invoices and receipts up ready for going to the accountants got everything ready apart from the bank statements aren\rquote t here yet.  
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Put fresh bales of silage in for the cows at morning.  Just as we finished Maggie from Tynedale arrived for her order and payment for last month.  She\rquote s always good crack w
hile we have our cup of tea.  We then set sail for Sandwith to get a load of fodder beet for the ewes.  But it was that frozen we could not knock them out so we simply cut them off at ground level with the loader bucket.  Had to be home for 4pm to meet a 
chap at the bungalow about a 3 piece suite which was the wrong shade of green.  Filled BSPS forms in for 10 claims and SPS form in for 2 claims.  Went to computer class at night.
\par 
\par Thursday.  Toddy had a full day leading muck out of the yard onto Leagate Field.  I done up then went with H}{\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774 to DI\rquote 
s funeral.  He was a good friend who was a farmer, a seed salesman, a keen hunt promoter, his family were keen on horses and above all enjoyed the crack.  He was 62 had a heart bypass a few years ago then
 he has been going for dialysis treatment for 2 years and has recently had a kidney transplant that his body refused. 
\par 
\par Friday.  TB test on the cattle this morning at 9.30 so I got a print out of all the cattle out of the computer to give us all the dates 
of birth.  All worked well, we were blessed with a good vet who could handle stock well and we were finished for lunchtime.  Gave us plenty of time after lunch to silage and bed everything up for the weekend. 
\par 
\par Saturday.  Done up nicely at morning but didn\rquote t scrape out because I felt it was going to thaw within 24 hours.  }{\insrsid8864230 DE}{\insrsid5454774 
 arrived for a load of straw before lunch.  Took a bale of silage out for some ewes after noon and had a good walk round Spring Kell.  Met up with KA shooting crows
.  Caught up with some of these diaries at evening and went to Egremont Young Farmers Club belated Christmas Social.  Good night and a good night enjoyed by all.
\par 
\par Sunday.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  driving all weekend.  So done up nicely in the morning scraping up well and gettin
g it done before it rained.  Took a couple of bales of silage out for sheep.  T. Dixon came for straw at 4pm.  Then had a feed of pheasant for Sunday Lunch.  Went to Drigg and District Young Farmers Club Advisory Meeting at Seascale at night.

ay.  Quite a lot of rain through the night and still raining.  Did up nicely and the vet came to read the TB test among herds.  Everything was OK.  Thank God.  Got the vet to sign a form for a lame cow to go on OTM casualty scheme.  This saved paying for 
a
 vet call-out as the Ministry was paying.  Andrews came and shot it and took it away later on.  Toddy took 8 bales of straw to Flemming Hall and we bought 38 bales of silage home from Haile.  Mother phoned in morning to say that Father had gone into hospi
tal at Carlisle.  He wasn\rquote t very well - didn\rquote t know whether it was a stroke or infection of the bladder.  They said he wasn\rquote t too bad at night. 
\par 
\par Tuesday.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 \rquote s going to be away on a course for 3 days so I weaned 10 bulls, at least she won\rquote t be able to hear them shouting.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774 
 came early morning to weld corner on the back door of the red trailer.  Toddy took it through and dropped it off at Grahams later on to be filled with stock feed potatoes through the week.  I had to go at 8am to meet a wagon with 20 
cu metres of liquid fertiliser to put in the tank at Sandwith.  Toddy spread a lot of very sloppy muck on the field in front of the house and pig field.  That I chap came to collect his diaries.
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Did a grease up job on beet harvester at morning
 then had to go for a medical for a renewal of my HGV Class 1 licence.  Not that I use it but one never knows when it might be useful.  Went after lunch to take some fodder beet off.  Got 2 loads off but chain broke 3 times.  Think it must be worn out.  S
pread one load out for the twin bearing ewes.  Ordered 10 tonnes beet pulp nuts to come through machinery ring.  Went to computer class at night.
\par 
\par Thursday.  Helped Toddy feed the sheep then left him to feed the cattle, put silage out for the ewes and bring
 the other load of beet home.  I went to Hexham for the Borders Sheep Fair, calling in at Carlisle Machinery Sale for a look round at 10am.  Found nothing of interest so carried on after 20 minutes.  Enjoyed the crack at Hexham and called in at Carlisle H
ospital on the way home to see Father.
\par 
\par Friday.  Toddy just here till 10am to help do up.  I went to Sandwith at morning to meet rep from the seed company who I bought my Autumn Triticale off which did not grow very well to inspect the cr
op.  He offered to send 500kg of replacement seed if I paid for 250kg.  I suppose anything is better than now}{\insrsid2063073 \rquote }{\insrsid5454774 
t.  Met a chap at home at 1pm who is suppose to be an expert on woodlands.  We had a good chat and a walk round the woods and he agreed with me they are a waste of time.
\par 
\par Saturday.  Done up nicely at morning without rain - makes a change.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  offered to take new tractor for potatoes to get the hang of driving it, seemed OK.  But when she got there managed to catch J\rquote 
s van with the front weights and do \'a3600 worth of damage to van.  Maybe wasn\rquote 
t a good idea.  All met at 4pm to get eyes tested.  I got issued with new glasses.  I went on to see Father afterwards calling in at Prospect for some clean clothes for him.  At evening }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  started putt

 till lunch time on the way home.  Toddy spent the day carting very watery slop out of the yards.  Went to Carlisle later on in the day to collect new elevator bars for the beet harvester and 
drop the Sheep Annual Payment Claim form off at DEFRA then in to see Father in Hospital.   
\par 
\par Tuesday.  Had to go and see the nurse at morning for annual check of the oil pressure etc.  Put fresh bales in feed passage for cows.  4 cu metres of ready mix concrete came to finish off bit at paddock gate, an area of LB\rquote 
s next door for a new stable and a bit round the dirty water tank.  I can\rquote t charge for the bit at LB\rquote s because her husband is the optician who I got the new glasses off (free).  Did a bit of paper work later in the day as well.
\par 
\par Wednesday.  It was a lovely morning, done up nicely.  Spent afternoon trimming feet and feeding lambs and trimming their tails.  Toddy bedded them all up well at the same time as well as taking bales to Guards a
nd bringing silage from Haile.  But I got wet later on and worse, went down with the bug at night.
\par 
\par Thursday.  They got Father out of Hospital today.  I am not a lot of good.  Toddy came in to help me feed the sheep then had to go off till dinner time.  I 
done the cows up then after dinner we went up to the corner field and cut the trees off along the roadside next to the wall.
\par 
\par Friday.  I helped Toddy to do up then as it was a horrible wet day I came back in the house out of the way to save myself for the weekend.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774

s done a draft for 2001-2 and worked it where we will have to pay no tax.  Marvellous really but I suppose its just a matter of putting adjusted figures in correct columns.
\par 
\par Tuesday.  A right bad wet day.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  finalised application for RDS grant and I spent probably 3 hours on it checking through.  You can see why people don\rquote 
t bother applying.  Took 8 bales of straw to Flemming Hall and brought 23 silage home from Haile.  Put a bale out for the tups and fresh bales in the feed passage.  It stopped raining afternoon and got out quite nice so as I had to collect }{
\insrsid5443691 E}{\insrsid5454774  from netball practice I took the new web chains to the beet harvester but it was that wet I could not get up the field..  
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Lovely clear morning, what a difference.  Had to let store cattle out onto the yard to bed them and fill the hoppers up so we castrated the bulls while they were out.  Put fresh silage out for al
l the ewes.  Then went to the beet harvester and fitted the new main web chain and gave it a whirl, brought a load home for the ewes on Guards.  I called in to see Alan Talfer on the way home.  Had a stiff neck at night, might have been holding it in an o
dd position while castrating calves.  
\par 
\par Thursday.  Toddy just here till 11am, he had to take Debbie to buy some wallpaper \lquote ha ha\rquote  at least that was his story.  So anyways we got everything done up and home well then I went and harvested 3 big loads of fodde
r beet at afternoon and brought a load home with me.  Harrvester went like a new one with that new web on it.
\par 
\par Friday.  Had to leave Toddy to do up himself while I went to meet Andrew Graham a \'85 agent who is going to put a claim into United Utilities for w
hen they removed power lines through our land at Sandwith.  It was a nice morning for a walk and change of crack.  Andrew is an ex-pupil of }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 \rquote 
s and has helped us on the farm in his youth during holidays etc.  once we got him out of the way got another 3 big loads of beet off.  Toddy carted them home all day - I got a puncture on the spreader.  Goodfellows going to mend it tomorrow.
\par 
\par Saturday.  Haven\rquote t scraped out for 3 days it was too frosty so it was a good crop this morning.  Took a while and silaged
 ewes all round.  Took empty trailer back to Sandwith and brought spreader home for ewes on Guards.  Went for a pint at night.  The \'85 shoot more all out and had a tatie pat (?) and a few pints.  Enjoyed the crack for x hours.
\par 
\par Sunday.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  and the girls up and away to a Pony Club Triathlon at Kirby Lonsdale for the day.  2 good loads of straw away at morning.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774 
 took knackered bearings off the crusher.  I then went up to Haile to see Aunty Shirley and }{\insrsid211149 M}{\insrsid5454774 .  Paid her for the heap of silage that was left on the farm.
\par 
\par 
\par }{\b\insrsid5454774 Week 59
\par }{\insrsid5454774 Monday.  A snowy bad day.  Had to take }{\insrsid5443691 [daughter?]}{\insrsid5454774 
 to school but got back and scraped out reasonably snow/rain free.  Then the snow came again.  Toddy gave all the outside sheep silage and went home at lunchtime.  }{\insrsid5443691 E}{\insrsid5454774  came hom
e from school at lunchtime too.  She went and did a bit of sledging but by 3pm it had stopped and maybe thawed a little.  I tool some posts and wire up to Haile on little blue trailer.
\par 
\par Tuesday.  A bit of frost but not a lot.  Scraped out sheep and went to Haile to meet Bill Beattie.  He\rquote 
s going to do some fencing for us so I had to show him what wanted done.  Then I took the old fence down in front of him along the lane side.  Had a phone call off }{\insrsid13772173 TN}{\insrsid5454774 . asking me to look after his lambing shed midday. 
 He was away at the auction.  I was a bit late but nothing was taking any harm and I bet him back \lquote just\rquote .  Toddy emptied muck out of the yard onto the Corner Field.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  away to Devon for 3 days
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Grand clear morning.  Excellent day to get ewes jabbed.  Brought singles in at morning before going to Haile to show Toddy what he was going to do, remove a lot of old thorns from behind a dyke next to EC}{\insrsid8864230 \rquote }{
\insrsid5454774 s fields in readiness for B
ill putting a fresh fence up.  Then I came back and injected first batch of sheep with Heptovax P and Coliovax.  Took them back and brought the twin bearing ewes down.  Got them all injected but too dark to take them back up the road.  So put them in fron
t of the house till morning.
\par 
\par Thursday.  Right wet morning.  }{\insrsid8864230 [name]}{\insrsid5454774  came to butch 4 sheep for us.  He\rquote s a ex-abattoir worker who is on the unemployed.  He probably does that many sheep for farmers he hasn\rquote 
t time to do a job as well.  Toddy took a load of straw to Flemming Hall and on to Haile for a trailer load of silage.   I did a lot of paper work at afternoon and went to the local branch of NFU meeting at night.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{
\insrsid5454774  arrived home at midnight.
\par 
\par Friday.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  at home today so she helped me inject
 the ewes that were inside and did a few hogg feet at morning.  Then disaster struck.  Toddy and I went out after dinner to set the blower up and pump some barley across the yard.  I was up there fastening the pipes to the wall, stepped back a foot missed
 my footing, landed on the floor and broke my leg.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  took me through to hospital for x-ray and plaster.  That\rquote s me knackered for 6-8 weeks.
\par 
\par Saturday.  Toddy came in to do up at morning.  }{\insrsid8864230 [name]}{\insrsid5454774  came back to cut the 4 sheep up and put them in deep freezer.  I sat and watched.  It was a very wet afternoon and night.  The dirty water pump was going continuous.

\par 
\par Sunday.  Toddy and }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  both here at morning.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  put new bearings in crusher and crushed a bit of oats.  Wilson came down at afternoon and put
 a new throttle cable on loader tractor and took the wheels off roller.  BB called in for the crack for 2 hours in afternoon.

\par }{\insrsid5454774 Monday.  It\rquote s a good job Toddy\rquote s here.  He got done up fed the ewes at Guards, then crushed some more oats, br
ought a load of bales from Haile unloaded it and loaded it up with 3 1/2 tonne of seed triticale.  Moved 2 1/2 tonne urea out of the lean-to into the barn then finished the day off crushing some oats.  He must have a good organiser!!  I put some feelers o
ut looking for someone to help with the sheep as they start lambing on the first of March.
\par 
\par Tuesday.  LF came to see about helping with sheep till 18}{\super\insrsid5454774 th}{\insrsid5454774  March, he seems OK, beggars can\rquote 
t be choosers.  He helped Toddy bag the rest of the oats up in the lean-to then they made it ready to put sheep in, moved feeding sheep into it and spread the ewes out better in the }{\insrsid9269329 poly tunnel}{\insrsid5454774 s.  }{\insrsid14746834 
[wife]}{\insrsid5454774  took me to hospital afternoon they took my plaster off then put a longer one on, right up above my knee so my leg now feels 2 metres long and an extra 50 kgs heavier. 
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Toddy got done up then leading muck into Corner Field.  I arranged for }{\insrsid211149 M}{\insrsid5454774  to go and collect a digger from Hunters at White
haven to do a few a jobs here at Mill House.  But he got a puncture before he got to the job so he didn\rquote t get started till 5pm but he did get Spring Kell.  Big Meadow Road side dykes cleaned out ready for fencing.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{
\insrsid5454774  went to work.  I just sat in the house with a long face answering the telephone.
\par 
\par Thursday.  }{\insrsid211149 M}{\insrsid5454774  got a full day on his digger and got the job done.  L}{\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774 and }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 
 injected twin bearing ewes from Guards and took them down to Haile at Dutch Barn field.  I had a ride with Les for 2 loads but that was plenty.  I just came back in the house and did nowt for the rest of day.
\par 
\par Friday.  Wilson came down for the day, so I got him driving me around in the Land Rover.  Had a good ride around everywhere and got all sorts of little jobs done.  Took
 a ewe to Guards, went to surgery for a sick note, Calderbridge for some hydraulic pipes, Haile to oversee some fertiliser unloaded, Wilton to collect a pipe.  Home 7 hours later ready for a sit down.  Toddy went to Whitehaven to take 2 loads of chicken m
uck out then Haile to unload 27 tonne fertiliser.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  went to Alderley Edge for }{\insrsid7282067 G}{\insrsid5454774  for 1/2 term.  He seems very pleasant, happy and taking less pills. 
\par 
\par Saturday.  Toddy and L}{\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774 fed up at morning.  AT and }{\insrsid8864230 [brother]}{\insrsid5454774  helping to get 3 loads of
 fodder beet off.  It was a bit clarty but we needed the beet so it had to be.  It all went more or less to plan.  A}{\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774 took the tractor through and }{\insrsid8864230 [brother]}{\insrsid5454774 
 took me through in the Land Rover.  I went round twice on the harvester to shout what was what.  Then retreated to Land Rover round the field with my leg up on the passenger seat using one foot for three pedals (just in low box though).
\par 
\par Sunday.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  was here all day.  Toddy had a day off.  L}{\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774 came to feed the sheep and went to Haile with }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 , they 
brought a ewe back that had prolapsed.  }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  later had to take 2 dead lambs away from her, she might live.  RJ came to empty all the slurry out of the dirty water tank.  It tends to get a build-up over the winter.  }
{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  put a new pole in an old wooden flat trailer.  I repaired the chain and roller on the muck spreader with my poly bag on my plastered foot.  
\par

\par }{\b\insrsid5454774 Week 61 
\par }{\insrsid5454774 Monday.  Bill came to start fencing the Corner Field and Spring Kell Big Meadow.  I went with him to Calderbridge for a load of posts and showed him where the fences were to go.  }{\insrsid2308136 TN}{\insrsid5454774 
 came to ask if I wanted a ride to Aiglegill near Aspatria as he was going for a load of crushed barley.  I agreed to go with him as I\rquote m not much good for anything else, we also called in to 
see my parents at Prospect on the way home.  Toddy brought 2 loads of fodder beet home and gave the outside ewes some with the spreader.
\par 
\par Tuesday.  Toddy had a long day, he mucked the }{\insrsid9269329 poly tunnel}{\insrsid5454774  out onto the Bottom Guards stubble.  We moved the ewes off G
uards onto Guards Park.  They seemed alright on stubble eating fodder beet and silage when it was wet but now when its frosty they seem parched.  Guards Park is full of grass.  Wilson came down to take me to the hospital.  They x-rayed it and told me it w
as doing nicely and sent me home for another 3 weeks.
\par 
\par Wednesday.  Les helped Toddy put the fresh bales in the passage for the cows.  He\rquote s been rebuilding the Corner Field wall and needed Toddy to take him some more stone so he had to help him a bit.  Got the other }{\insrsid9269329 poly tunnel}{
\insrsid5454774  mucked out today.  I went to Cockermouth Market with }{\insrsid13772173 TN}{\insrsid5454774 , he had some fat hoggs in.  we took }{\insrsid7282067 G}{\insrsid5454774  and A}{\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774 
with us as well.  I think they enjoyed the day better than us.  
\par 
\par Thursday.  Mucked the calf crap out onto midden, then spread the muck out of the yard onto Corner Field.  I went to Whitehaven in the afternoon with }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 , the girls and }{\insrsid7282067 G}{\insrsid5454774 
.  I needed to get a photo of myself to put in with my HGV licence renewal.  I then went down the street into Moons Bookshop and ordered a laminated map of West Cumbria with all the field boundaries on, might be useful.
\par 
\par Friday.  Toddy just here till dinner time, he\rquote s got a cold.  He got everything fed though.  Honest to God I can\rquote t think what I did.  I\rquote d probably done what I\rquote m supposed to do with a broken leg (nowt).  
\par 
\par Saturday.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  came in early at morning to weld the back door on the red trailer.  Took it through to Sandwith later on with the blue trailer.  Had to uplift silage off the ewes at Haile as they weren\rquote 
t eating it.  There was also a bale Michelle had for the horses that wasn\rquote 
t getting eaten to uplift.  The cows will clean them up.  After lunch Wilson came down and we emptied most of the barley out of an outside grain bin into the barn for easy access to it.
\par 
\par Sunday.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  and }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  fed cows and scraped out at morning.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774  then went off to do 2 hours driving and came back at 1pm.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{
\insrsid5454774  then went through on loader tractor to Sandwith and Wilson took me through in Land Rover.  When they got started taking beet off I drove the Land Rover down to Anthony Telfers, had a cup of tea then A}{\insrsid8864230  }{\insrsid5454774 
drove me round a few fields at Sandwith to have a look at various crops and the problems associated to them.  We then went back to watch them taking beet off for a while and he slipped me home.

\par }{\b\insrsid8864230 \page }{\b\insrsid5454774 Week 62 
\par }{\insrsid5454774 Monday.  At Newton Rigg today on a Health and Safety Course.  Worked in nicely got a ride through with }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774 
 right to the door, it was paid for by the state because I was on the sick.  I even enjoyed it especially the company I was in.
\par 
\par Tuesday.  I\rquote ve got to get something done.  Wilson came down at lunchtime to go to Sandwith to take some beet off.  So I got }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  to take the big tractor and roller through as well.  Got JG}{\insrsid8864230  }{
\insrsid5454774 to give me a lift through and bring }{\insrsid14746834 [wife]}{\insrsid5454774  back and I rolled 60 acres of winter cereals, not bad for one day.
\par 
\par Wednesday.   Two people from Rural Development Service came to discuss grant application for Holiday let and arena jobs, took till lunchtime.  Got Jane to take me back to the roller and I finished the job, anothe
r 35 acres.  Back at 5pm.  I dare not drive tractors on the main road though, not yet anyhow.  }{\insrsid8864230 CP}{\insrsid5454774 
 came and collected me to go to the Civic Hall at Whitehaven to watch the Young Farmers Club Annual Drama/Entertainment competitions.  Nice to see our team come equal second.  It\rquote s always good crack at YFC meetings.  I\rquote 
ve maybe mentioned before I was president of the local club in 97-98-99.  You never really grow too old for YFC just too old to compete at inter club competitions.
\par 
\par Thursday. Set Toddy off cultivating top Guards up with the Dina Drive (it sort of cultivates land without bringing stones up).  }{\insrsid8864230 AF}{\insrsid5454774 
 came to buy some straw and took 2 bales with him.  Enjoyed a bit crack with him.  He bought his limousin stock bull off us 10 years ago and is still going strong.  AT
 called in for the crack so I collared him to give me a ride round in the Land Rover.  If I didn\rquote t I would see nothing.
\par 
\par Friday.  Toddy took straw to Flemming Hall and a load to AF}{\insrsid8864230 \rquote }{\insrsid5454774 s bringing silage back from Haile.  Went with Les and we let ewes into some fresh fields at Haile.  Me and }{\insrsid8864230 [brother]}{\insrsid5454774 
 put the plough on and brought it round to the workshop door to put some fresh bits on it.  A ewe died today with a ruptured vaginal prolapse.
\par 
\par Saturday.  These ewes had better steady up we lost 2 today.  Thinking they are maybe too well fed and pushing their back ends too much.  Toddy came into do up and took 2 trailers to Sandwith.  }{\insrsid8864230 [brother] }{\insrsid5454774 
came down and we went to take beet off.  Got three good loads and the rain came down at tea time.   
\par Sunday.  Started lambing time lambs today, a set of 3 and a single one.  Wilson came down and we went to take beet off, had a fair day.  }{\insrsid7040607 K}{\insrsid5454774 
 carted them away.  I drove the harvester and Wilson did the running about because I can\rquote t.
