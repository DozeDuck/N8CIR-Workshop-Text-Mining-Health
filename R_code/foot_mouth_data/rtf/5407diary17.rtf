 evil of Sadam Hussein.  Events and reading confirm the issue, it is Stalingrad all over again and the arrogance of the Bush administration off
ends me.  I like womanising US presidents, they are more interested in peace.  This will end sadly both for the UK (and Tony Blair) and the Arab world.  The USA will just walk away.  I have written a prayer for peace for the SRF meeting on the 4}{

(70+) is determined to go. Possible trip tomorrow.  The boat leaves and bounces over the sea with about 10 passengers. It collects some other at Fionnaport. I go for a long walk to the macha
ir. On returning to the Abbey we met the very very wet Staffa pilgrims. They were allowed ashore for only 15 minuets. D}{\fs24\insrsid10108082  }{\fs24\insrsid7147341 
left the boat but did not feel secure enough to visit the cave. We got them home and they change and dry out. Evidently even the cabin w
as inundated and three passengers were sick. Quite and adventure. Evening meal and then a service for healing. We were all very moved and discussed it in detail. On return to Cumbria we are determined to look into this, but it would have to be different. 
Pub again then back to bed.
