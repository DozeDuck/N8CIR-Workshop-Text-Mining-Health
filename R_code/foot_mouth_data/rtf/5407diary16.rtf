\fs24\insrsid8286199 Somehow reluctant to start this diary. I think it has to do with FMD scares at the end of last week. As I heard them on the radio I got that same knotted, churning sensation inside that seemed to be a primary feature of the wh
ole of last year! Looking at my own diary for the week all looks pretty uneventful but then you never can tell in this job. p.m. to Greengarth to lead a \lquote hymn sandwich\rquote  for the residents. They are always sparky and give you a lift.
\par 26}{\fs24\super\insrsid8286199 th}{\b\fs24\insrsid8286199  }{\fs24\insrsid8286199 Our Sunday School quite logically meets on a Tuesday in the local school at 3.30. It\rquote 
s growing in popularity and we regularly have 20+ kids and they can be a real handful - I don\rquote t know why, but today they were \lquote off the wall\rquote  but the feedback was good. Caelan\rquote s mum said that
 when she had asked him if he had enjoyed himself (it was his first time), he said it was, and I quote, \lquote it was ace, I had a drink and two biscuits\rquote .
\par 27}{\fs24\super\insrsid8286199 th}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  Day off. I try to be religious (no pun intended) about this - in my line of work you are never really off duty. Case in point, popped into the pub this evening and }{\fs24\insrsid1275715 
spent an hour and a half with M }{\fs24\insrsid8286199 and V who had just come back from Bolton after a harrowing visit to a dear friend who is terminally ill with lung cancer. Not easy going.
\par 28}{\fs24\super\insrsid8286199 th}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  It has been a pretty surreal day today. To Ullswater Community College this a.m. - it was J\rquote s \lquote review day\rquote  she is in the last year of sixth form and has 
offers from all Uni choices about which she is rightly chuffed (better than her sisters!!). She is planning to defer her entry for 12 months but whether or not this will happen is another question - all seems to be going well. Thence to the dentist - last
 remaining lower teeth out and plate in. An interesting experience - not sure who was shaking more me or the dentist. And then in the evening to }{\fs24\insrsid13978454 A}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  Hall\'85\'85
the final meeting of the Community Centre Trustees. Into the Earl\rquote s inner sanctum and a large glass of whiskey. Over the years I have discovered that the country gentry don\rquote t understand words like \lquote just\rquote  and \lquote a drop
\rquote . Two minutes spent flicking through the accounts and an hour and a half reviewing the situation post FMD. Most of our farmers are restocking but they are very, very cautious.
\par 1}{\fs24\super\insrsid8286199 st}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  March}{\b\fs24\insrsid8286199  }{\fs24\insrsid8286199 What an irony, St. }{\fs24\insrsid805033 David\rquote s}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  Day and the EU are reclassifying leeks!! Oh well\'85
.. To Carlisle today}{\fs24\insrsid14814925 ,}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  R to the endoscopy unit and me visiting patients. One of the things I enjoy most about rural ministry is the way in which you become \lquote adopted\rquote 
 into the extended family. There is an intimacy (some would say an incestuous ness) about the rural community - the 
\par spiders web of relational and friendship bonds is so far reaching that you cannot as a clergy person avoid being involved in a huge number of peoples lives. So after visiting and drinking a coffee I spend \'be
 of an hour chatting unexpectedly (?) with parishioners, acquaintances, friends all of whom are in the hospital for a variety of reasons - small world or perhaps ju
st a small population and its part of the reason why so many have been damaged and remain scarred by the FMD outbreak.

Perhaps the most pressing item on all rural church agendas is the problem of raising money not just to pay the clergy and their expenses but to keep open their often ancient and listed church buildings. All my churches struggle at the best of times and a
re heavily reliant on visitors and fund raising. Last year had a devastating effect on all of that and money has become incredibly tight. In fact I am not sure how long my parishes can go on as they are \endash 
 fortunately all the church buildings are in a good condition which means our efforts to raise cash will enable us to keep going on a day to day basis, but that doesn\rquote t replace the photocopier.

 Quiet week this week as far as the diary is concerned so I\rquote m planning to spend time on our church brochures. One of th
e significant things to emerge from FMD as far as my rural parishes were concerned was the almost total disappearance of visitors. My most visited church (Lowther, }{\fs24\insrsid2970418 SJ}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  3 in his 1000 best churches) has just \'be
 page of entries in the visitors book between March and September 2001, as opposed to 35 pages the year before! The knock-on effect for the pubs, B & Bs and the local shop were huge, indeed the Punch Bowl in }{\fs24\insrsid13978454 A}{
\fs24\insrsid8286199  is now temporarily closed \endash  }{\fs24\insrsid2975068  }{\fs24\insrsid8286199 the landlord has gone into voluntary liquidation and the Post Offic
e/shop is struggling, takings were down by over 50% last year! A stark indication of how significant tourism is to our small patch. One of the things we have all come to realise is just how much we took the tourists for granted. Back in the Autumn of 2001
 }{\fs24\insrsid2975068 R}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  got involved with a project which is being masterminded (?) by the Churches Tourism Group nationally called \lquote hidden Britain\rquote 
. The idea being that the church at the local level work alongside all aspects of the community to help in the process of rebuildi
ng and regeneration, particularly in Cumbria, following FMD and act as centres for the spreading of information about what can be seen and done locally and hopefully encouraging more visitors. So far, \lquote hidden Britain\rquote 
 has not found the funding the funding the project needs, but the concept did rather press my button.
\par So\'85not only did the community take the visitors for granted but so did the church, and that\rquote s where the brochures come in. I\rquote m working on a whole series of leaflets which attempt to interpret t
he history/architecture/local tales, myths and legends of the churches and local community along with things like gentle local walks and wet weather attractions plus info on the pubs, B & Bs, shops, etc\'85
the idea being the better the experience visitors get, the more likely they are a) to come back and b) to spread the word, especially if they have a good experience \endash  here\rquote s hoping.

\par p.m. To Rose Castle to meet with Bishop Graham, a lovely sunny afternoon the fields full of stock reflect sadly on this time last year and reckon we would not have been making the journey. Ultimately a useful meeting, he has said that }{
\fs24\insrsid2975068 R}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  can transfer from non-stipendiary to stipendiary ministry but there are no jobs for her. Unhelpful, however it became clear that

\par I was right, the BBC have overrun my life. I have run round photocopying reams of service orders, finding readers, waiting for phone call from producers and sound engineers which never come\'85
Today we recorded the service. I was at Broughtham Chapel from 2.00 pm until I finally locked up at 11.35 p.m. I actually found the recorded process fascinating even if the service itself is dire.
\par The producers Stephen Shipley had actually wanted to record it in Windsor Chapel \endash  I name drop \endash 
 Jonathan Rees-Williams the organist and choir master there is the son of one of my former church wardens at Brougham and his sister is one of my parishioners. IB who wrote the service
 persuaded him that Brougham was better as it is close to the spot where in 974 A.D. the Kings of the English tribes gathered to agree Christianity as the national religion, Iwon the day.
\par May 5}{\fs24\super\insrsid8286199 th}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  The service goes out just after 8.00 am. It hangs together well \endash 
 I was keen to see what they had edited out as they had recorded 43 mins and had only used 37 mins airtime. Am embarrassed by my parsonical tones. Later am asked by the Prof. Emeritus in my }{\fs24\insrsid13978454 A}{\fs24\insrsid8286199

s own inquiry into FMD. I have found it very difficult to listen to the reports on local radio. I actually avoided the Farm and Countryside programme on Wednesday evening which was wh

to school for her GCSE exam Monday pm. As I drive past Whale farm I have this sudden flashback of disinfectant, pressure washers-it's a bit unsettling.
\par Thursday evening to Abbott Lodge and their ice-cream opening. Post FMD }{\fs24\insrsid13179138 [farmers there]}{\fs24\insrsid8286199 
 have diversified. They have bought in a Jersey herd and have transformed one of their buildings into an ice-cream factory. It should have opened three weeks ago but bureaucracy being what it is... C says \lquote 
we only invited our contractors and those were good to us to the 
\par foot-and-mouth\rquote , I feel highly honoured. The set-up is impressive and if hard work and determination can for any think they were surely make a success of it.
\par Sunday, at long last the Lowther baptism. It has been arranged for months. We have a church full and it is a really happy occasion with the party after. I recall another baptism last year, we couldn't get back to the Scarfoo
t because of FMD but the party was as they say \lquote a good do\rquote , the conversation was all foot-and-mouth.
\par Every new beginning and every special occasion it seems to bring with it FMD baggage, so small is our community and so heavily affected were we, that there is no escape. But I expect the I suspect there it is all part of the healing process.\line

had a quadruple bypass some years ago but has never been fully well since. It is going to be a difficult funeral, two wives who forgery get on well, but daughter given to hysterics.
\par Things become more complicated. }{\fs24\insrsid13179138 [he]}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  want
ed to be cremated and the soonest available spot at the crematorium is next Monday. So we are to have his funeral on Friday morning and to go to the crematorium after the weekend. I have a feeling this is going to be a difficult week pastorally!
\par 12th June,
 Clifton and Brougham Parish coffee morning. We have rallied at the troops because it is being hosted by a couple relatively new to the area and this is their first time. They haven't been to church here yet but regularly travel back to their old parish, 
about 12 miles away. It is one of the wonderfully endearing and quirky aspects of rural ministry that folk are prepared to travel relatively long distances to retain links with the church they feel is their home. 
\par B}{\fs24\insrsid13179138 W}{\fs24\insrsid8286199 's funeral this morning and I was right, 
I have spent a couple of hours each day this week with one or another member of the family. All goes off well. In the afternoon to I go to Ninekirks to clean up before Sunday's services. It is wonderful to be able to walk the mile across fields to this hi
d
den gem. It is the original Parish Church for a Brougham, rebuilt by Lady Anne Clifford in the 1640s and it retains all its original furnishings and detail. It is now cared for by the Historic churches Preservation Trust and we hold an number of evensongs
 there are through the summer (no electric).
\par The farmer whose fields we have to cross has not yet restocked and all these fields are down to Bali barley. It feels bored not encountering sheep and cattle as in previous years but it does make not having to op
en a close all those gates less irksome. 16th June evensong at the 3:00pm and it is a great success with a good turnout of folk. The general consensus is that it is good to be back. 
\par 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid8286199 Diary 17
\par }{\fs24\insrsid8286199 17th June, to the crematorium. One of the things you learn ear
ly on in rural ministry is that nothing is readily or easily accessible. For example it is a 50 mile round trip from here to the crematorium and across country at that. So, taking a funeral at the crematorium uses up half a day, give or take. B\rquote 
s committal takes 10 minutes!
\par We're moving into the quiet phase of the year and thankfully I have quiet week in which to catch up with some pastoral visiting. This is often very restoring as you seem to receive as much as you give.
\par 25th June, the Wessex and Fine Arts
 Group visit, this is another of those delayed visits. They should have come about this time last year, but because part of their itinerary meant visiting farm buildings it all had to be rescheduled. What I thought was to be a \lquote 15 minute polite
\rquote  has become an all-day session, taking in }{\fs24\insrsid13978454 A}{\fs24\insrsid8286199 
 Hall in the morning and Lowther church in the afternoon. As I drive through the park the course builders are starting to construct the obstacles for the driving trials next month. Somehow this is all very healing, things ge
tting back to normal. The local paper is full of dates for hound shows, terrier shows, agricultural shows, etc. The normal round of countryside events at the heart of our social calendar, the warp and weft. I suspect however that there will be an emotiona
l cost for all of us.
\par 26 June, to Newcastle to be measured for the monkey suit. The wedding plans to move on apace. As fond as I am of Newcastle, I just cannot see why anyone would choose to live surrounded by all that noise, traffic and but. I own up, I ha
ve become the country bumpkin!

\par Wednesday morning, bumped into T}{\fs24\insrsid13179138  and }{\fs24\insrsid8286199 his mother a feisty American lady, has been taken ill and hospitalised whilst visiting his sister in Barcelona. She really will have to give up the fags. T}{

\par A Friday late afternoon, popped up into the Post Office, Helston road is full of fire appliances, ambulances and police and they're just to }{\fs24\insrsid13179138 bring A}{\fs24\insrsid8286199  out of the house, dead by 
\par the look of it, a the doctor tries resuscitation but it is no use. Just recently she has had chronic psychiatric problems! I just hope she hasn't said the fire herself. But 
people standing about not really watching, it simply concerned. This sort of thing has touched a small community deeply and painfully we're all know each other so well. It is part of the reason why FMD and its impact has been carved so deeply into our hea
rts. I meet C's brother later as I go to his mother's house in Hilton. They have just got back from a funeral in Carlisle, he is utterly distraught. At Helton I find they are all stunned. What can you say? A}{\fs24\insrsid13179138  }{\fs24\insrsid8286199 
has been taken to Carlisle}{\fs24\insrsid675309 , there ha}{\fs24\insrsid8286199 s to be a pos

melting which is why there was so much dense black smoke.

Sometimes there are things which must be done over which you have little or no control. The quinquennial inspection is one such a thing. All churches must be inspected by an accredited architect every five years. He then reports on the state of the fabric
 of the building and what repairs need to be undertaken. It is the turn of the Clifton Church and Brougham Chapel, however, as neither church is open during the day nor the keys to them readily accessible it\rquote 
s down to me to be available to open them up and be available for the architect. I have just managed to tie him down after much \lquote toing and froing\rquote  of e-mails. He plans to do Clifton tomorrow and Brougham on Friday.

Thank goodness for a quiet week in which to recover. Perhaps my initial reaction to the success of the horse trials was over optimistic. Certainly attendance figures were up by at least 10% on 2 years ago \endash 
 the last time it was able to be held BUT the organisers had jacked Saturday/Sunday entry prices up by 50% to \'a312 for adults \endash 
 albeit there was no charge for children under 12 and also hiked pitch rents for traders who were reporting very mixed success. Several thought that the show had \lquote lost its way\rquote 
 and would not be coming back though they had been regulars over many years. Indeed, on reflection, there were quite a lot of traders who had been regulars who were not there this year. Whether that reflected
 the fact that because of FMD there was no show last year and that they had found alternative venues or that the rental prices for stall space was considered too high I do now know. As these people became our parishioners over the weekend we try to spend 
as much time as possible on the show field talking with and listening to them. It will be interesting to know whether any of this feeds back to the show director and if so what his response is.

\par The reception at the Inn on the Lake at Glenridding was also a little surreal. As the photographer took rom

y year when the people I have booked weddings for the previous summer suddenly realise that the time is shorter than they think.  So, last week I had a crop of phone calls from brides-to-be and this week is full of wedding interviews.  Weddings are one of
 the more pleasurable activities in clergy life especially when you get a couple who realise that they can be much more involved in personalising their marriage ceremony and don\rquote

\par January 28.  I always make a point of going to the Farmers Market in Penrith although it doesn\rquote

 The occasional offices, baptisms, weddings and funerals are huge opportunities to come close to people and share some of the most significant times in their lives.  Each one is unique and the work involved in ensuring the personalising of the event is de
manding, but none more so than funerals.  So many people come with their expectations and you have to try to get it right for all of them.  So this is going to be a demanding week supporting the families not least because both funerals are not now
