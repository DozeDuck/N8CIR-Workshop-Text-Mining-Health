ke them to the Sands Centre for the day - lunch too - they did enjoy it, but all young children like to see baby animals - the calves, goat's, chicks etc were very popular! (even the farm children like visiting other farms and seeing animals) 
\par Friday night was our night out at Craigburn Catlowdy to celebrate with all past staff etc of the infant school - the end of the school. It was a good night!
\par }{\fs24\insrsid27804 [elder daughter]}{\fs24\insrsid14701979  has decided that I need a holiday she has booked us into a five-star hotel in Paphos ({\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname country-region}}Cyprus{\*\xmlclose}

Got some school work done this week. I'm needed new planning sheets made for school - so }{\fs24\insrsid27804 [elder daughter]}{\fs24\insrsid14701979  helped me - reminded me how to do it - made three and then I had a go and did one myself.\line 
I have real problems remembering the steps to do things
 like this on the computer - I've been on loads of courses but you need to practice and do things every day - which I don't. I've decided that my brain is too old to remember all these new things. I'm much faster with a pen - even if it is difficult to re

We've been shopping for new swimwear, sarongs, T-shirts etc and all the Clarins sun creams and after-sun for our holiday. 
\par I still can't quite believe I'm going to do this. I found a lady in Morecambe who is going to make me My Mother Of the Bride outfit to }{\fs24\insrsid2375755 [younger daughter]}{\fs24\insrsid14701979 
's wedding in October. We went to see her on Tuesday evening and she drew what I wanted and I chose fabrics. She is going to send me a swatch for me to check that that's what I really want.  I think it's going to look pretty good.

\par Thank goodness this week is over! Monday the class had to do a full dress-rehearsal of our little production for the whole school. We had to be all ready for {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 9}}
{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 30}}}9:30am{\*\xmlclose}. Luckily, I have some good parents who volunteered their services and so everything went quite well. The children looked really good i
n their costumes but we had five absent which did cause us a few headaches. The rest of the school enjoyed it and clapped enthusiastically so my children were really pleased with themselves. Tuesday was "the performance"! {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 10}}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 0}}}10:00am{\*\xmlclose} - hall full of parents etc
 - creche arranged the youngsters - mainly to stop them making a terrible din during the performance. As part of our audience we had a Chinese delegation for Sure Start (the nursery business). They watched with big smiles and were really lovely to the chi
l
dren as they came off the stage. My little star had his photo taken with some of them for the local press - his mum was very proud (she is one of my helpers - always willing, and a dinner lady too!)  By the time we were all changed and had our fruit and d
rinks and a little playtime, it was almost lunchtime. So we had our "well done" cakes and juice in the afternoon. They all enjoyed that.\line 
The rest of the week passed in a mad rush to make our Christmas decorations, cards etc and trying to make that awful classroom look bright and cheerful. We have a beautiful real tree which helps enormously. I forgot to say that on our concert day we had }
{\fs24\ul\insrsid14701979 six }{\fs24\insrsid14701979 children absent - all with chickenpox - some of the children went on stage with different costumes and play different 
parts - they were amazing! I sometimes feel that we really underestimate our four year-olds!!

 got started in my new classroom\line Spent Thursday doing the same - it looks quite good but no cupboards and lots less space than I'm used to. Friday, (the boss) decided we needed a staff meeting }{\fs24\ul\insrsid14701979 all morning}{
\fs24\insrsid14701979 !!!  We only got through half the agenda but w
e all said we needed time in our rooms - that is why we took two days of our holidays (Tuesday/Wednesday) to move so that we could have the two days allowed for the move making the rooms ready for the children! Or as ready as it could be, still no built-i

\f0\fs24\insrsid14701979  (4 inspectors for 3 days). So that means no October break somewhere warm \endash  I\rquote ll really miss that, and a lot of this holiday spent in school on school work.

\par After I\rquote d finished and we had lunch }{\f0\fs24\insrsid2375755 [husband]}{\f0\fs24\insrsid14701979  and I walked around the grounds looking at all the animals.
\par Watching the faces of the people whose animals were winning brought quite a lump to my throat. They were so proud of their achievements and when I think back to  the FMD outbreak to see people happy with their animals was quite a tonic.
\par I still see quite often a farmer who always waved as I passed and then one day he was
 breaking his heart as all his dairy herd and sheep were being slaughtered and then burnt on his farm I still see him, the scar on his field has gone and he smiles and waves again. I bet he }{\f0\fs24\ul\insrsid14701979 never}{\f0\fs24\insrsid14701979

t play foot and mouth with the toy farm any more, their memories have faded, but some of the older ones mention it now and again. The land has certainly recovered faster (and better?) than the people on it.
