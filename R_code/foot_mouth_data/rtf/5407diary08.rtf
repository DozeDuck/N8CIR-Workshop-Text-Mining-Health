An old African proverb states, "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is now."
\par I should have started this diary over a year ago to keep track of changes in the unrolling of the FMD epidemic and my feelings towards it. Today is probably a good day to start the diary as I was about to sit down after a really bad w
eek to write some comments for the lessons learned inquiry and thought I should check the web site for an update. I found out to my considerable annoyance that the inquiry was coming to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname country-region}}Cumbria{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} to meet with DEFRA and hold the open meeting on Tuesday night,
 and if you wanted a ticket to attend, then you had to apply by a week ago. The overall impression is that the govt do not want to learn lessons. I was looking after kids as }{\fs24\insrsid10313242 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278 
 was on counselling course and I was on call Sat morn. The vets were busy so I ended up taking }{\fs24\insrsid13305128 [children]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  into vets with me they watched videos in the waiting room while I sorted out and consulted. 
\par Coming down with cold after spending Friday TB testing on restocking farm. But at least I managed to avoid getting kicked and crushed. The farm hand who is one of the hard lads of Wigton refused to get in with the fat bulls to test them after getting floo
red by a kick. \'93If the f.** ministry want them F tested they can f coming and etc etc\'94 I am putting in a letter to say why they were not tested to see response.
\par Didn\rquote t get finished on farm till 5.45 pm having started with a caesarean at 5:30am.Must be an ea
sier way to make a living. The farming economy is bizarre at the moment . He has silage in heaps all over the farm, so instead of feeding straw which is incredibly expensive @\'a3
70 ton he is feeding the better quality silage and the calves are all too big. There are 30 to calve, so a few nights work there\'85.
\par Where ever I go on farms the stories that farmers are wanting to get off their chest about the MAFF incompetence and inconsistency is bewildering. There is a lot of anger out there.
\par I went to do the restocking sentinel visit for MG, L
 Fm. He is usually the most laid back of guys but he told them he was bringing his cattle on and he would see them in court. Why are we doing sentinel visits to a farm that had FMD 11 months ago? The virus only lives a month.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid5271442 G & R}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  called around Sun afternoon, he is pessimistic about fertiliser sales. There is that much land and grass around
, and the govt grants for extensification. New regulations on nitrates is giving him a headache though as he points out it is not fertiliser that cause the problems, as they are used by grass but by phosphates and slurry/organics . Lough Neigh has real pr
oblems with algal blooms and they are blaming fertiliser but so has Bassenthwaite, but there is not any fertiliser spread on the fells so is it really agriculture?

 Early morning call to see a farmer who is a scrap metal dealer who hates authority. He therefore didn\rquote t want anyone on his land during FMD, and refused acce

es was too great to hide. He also runs a fishery/ shellfish enterprise that is on the beach at odd times!!??. He was found guilty and fined \'a3
350 for his trouble but never paid because he went bust, as everything is in his wife and kids names!! This is all unsubstantiated rumour but quite amusing. When push comes to shove the ministry could do nothing with out the cooperation of the Farmers!

\par }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 The dates important cos its my Birthday, 39 today. The kids all brought presents i
n and had breakfast in Bed it was really nice. The number of ordinary calls to ill animals is increasing rapidly. Went to 2 new restocking farms today. I think one a day is probably enough. They were both full of stories about the ministry and wanted to u
n
load to some one who understood. The first was particularly upsetting in that I was admiring his new parlour and set up that he has put in while waiting the 4 months. He was then talking about all the animals getting slaughtered and his wife was fighting 
b
ack tears. She is also very unsure about whether they are doing the right thing by investing in the new parlour. She is very unsure about the future and as they are both reaching 50 is it the right thing to be doing? Unfortunately I think she is right, bu
t I couldn\rquote 
t say that and made reassuring noises as they have spent the money and it is too late now. The future for dairy is not good. The price is going to continue to be at world prices which with the current exchange rate is uneconomic in the UK. The se
cond farm was sheep with drop, and they were grazing over the burial site as they had planted carrots and turnips on the surrounding field. I couldn\rquote 
t listen to another set of woes, as I was still upset from the first lot so kept conversation light and on sheep.

I never realised that FMD is like any other grief there are anniversaries to get through, and fears and barriers to be put to rest. I was on a farm to give certificates to 2 heifers sold in calf. They were all saying it was a year to the day th
at FMD hit the village. The AI fellow was there as well, and he was talking about what he had been doing. He was saying that he thinks it will be years before everybody returns to normal. He is revisiting farms where he was helping with the slaughter for 
the AI, and was saying he had to take a deep breath every time he returns to one of these farms. 
\par There was a partners meeting at lunchtime. As usual AW turned up late, but finally decided to advertise to see whether there are Vets out there who will come t
o work in FMD country. It is a bit frustrating as I foresaw that we would be busy, and we could have nabbed D}{\fs24\insrsid15092794  }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 
before Longtown, but GG ever cautious. We went completely around in circles trying different options, but as with everything else the only prediction we can make is that we know that we don\rquote

n Friday as another large test today, started at 8:30am and finished at 6pm but at least it meant I was out the office and did not have to face any of the usual hassle factors. It was good to see as the place is always well run and organised. A real famil

 I cannot be bothered to make it for one as the kids never have it and so are very conservative. They were asking my view of the future too as they have sold bullocks privately ie not through the auction as they are on 21 day stand still and the price is 
poorer than selling via the auction. DEFRA will not allow any trade through an auction if the farms are on standstill. Why? If they are dead in24hrs there is minimal risk and they are putting everyone\rquote s backs up.

       (and me) when he was sent flying by one of their team. His Dad then shouted \'93Ref if you gave a penalty for them for nothing you could at least give us a foul for that!\'94
 At which point the ref blew his whistle and came across and thumped him. The whol

\par The reasons are varied but one of them is that my 
youngest lost his temper with the computer and slammed down the mouse. This broke the left-right bar so the pointer would only go up and down!! Now the practice manager who learnt his computing in the dark ages of DOSS, assures me you do not need a mouse 
to operate a computer. But as I have enough problems trying to get the stupid machine to do what I want it to with a mouse, forget trying shortcut keys and arrows.
\par 
\par So a new mouse was bought which the man assured my wife you just had to plug in, and hey pre
sto it would find a driver and work. Blank screens, consult hand book, try inserting disk, try exploring disk, try windows disk, consult practice manager, who as you may have gathered is my IT guru. He says you may need to install a driver if it doesn
\rquote t work it will be on the disk. I don\rquote t have a mouse to use to try to find and install a driver, he assures me again you don\rquote 
t need a mouse. I understand why my youngest son lost his temper with the stupid machine. Being the mature adult that I can some times be I walk away to cool off, but don\rquote 
t feel like trying again for 24 hours with a new mouse which the man assured my wife you just had to plug in, and hey presto it would find a driver and work.
\par Plugged it in, it said \'93looking for driver\'94, \'93installing Driver\'94 and it worked. Why?

\par There is now no slaughterhouse within an hour\rquote

 the slaughterhouse. However under the new meat hygiene regulations of 2-3 years ago the carcase has to arrive within an hour of being shot. Which was fine while Black Brow was operating the slaughterhouse, but since it has closed, there are no options fo
r
 any animals to be shot on the farm. (Unless you put it in your own freezer for your own consumption.) Thus whereas if there were borderline cases before, they were shot on the farm, and the carcases transported. Now the pressure is to get them transporte
d alive. Or the farmer loses the value of the animal \'a3500-\'a3600, and has to pay \'a375 to get them shot and disposed of. The sooner either {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}Carlisle{\*\xmlclose}

 out with FMD late on and they had just got the herd to where they wanted the breeding. Her mum was talking about it was going through a grieving period, and how some days it was yes carry on and get going again, and other days it was why bother? It is ju
s
t all too much hassle. It will take a long time for the memories in the farming community to fader, and with the acknowledgement that it was much better to get the disease and get it over with, the cooperation of farmers will be even less. They are the 17

 generation on the farm!! The whole concept of bio security needs to be looked at and farmer education on how the disease is spread. The self-imposed isolation of not sending kids to school etc is just stupid but to go against the flow is very difficult. 
That as well as the DEFRA imposed ridiculous rules. They were not allowed to leave the house for 3 months. They just view this as a punishment imposed because they refused to let the hefted flock be culled. (They were right not to.)

 point to take him to where she was meeting the boyfriend and there he attacked him. The sort of story you only here about in the papers and crime programmes. So we have had the police taking statements and trying to come to terms with it. He is usually a
 mild almost submissive personality and he had flipped but really weird.

\par On days like this I think it is great to be a small animal vet, the Consults were all straight forward and I could chat to the owners with out having to stop and think what to do about the animals. That and 2 
owners were really appreciative of what I was doing so felt good. I think that is one of the things about working for DEFRA no one appreciated what you were doing. OK some appreciated the concern and effort, and the way you did it but no one really though
t what you were doing was good. Like putting pets down. It is for the best but no one likes it.
\par Beautiful day today too, the sun shining and picking strawberries and having a Bar B Q was really very pleasant. My brother always says the best thing about NZ w
here he lives is that he can plan to have a Barb in 2 wks time, whereas here, you have to go with the flow.

\par A police man arrived at the front desk while I was on the phone. The head nurse disappeared as soon as she saw the marked Police car, which struck me as very suspicious. After he had booked an appointme

a

 set up with over 12,000 people coming together over 3 weeks in Keswick and meeting up for Bible teaching and to worship God. There is a big tent that is set up on the back of the convention centre. By the time we arrive, it is always full, and we were no
t
 late. On the Friday evening there were people standing outside. The kids went to a Youth event on of all things Ezekiel, not exactly an easy choice of Bible book to convey to 19-14 yr olds. But they really enjoyed the wacky games and the way they mixed t
eaching and songs and games/activities. They seemed to be mostly uni students who seemed to get as much fun out of it as the kids. My brother and family were up and the cousins love getting together and even }{\fs24\insrsid15092794 A}{

t sailing which was great fun. The kids had a canoe and we raced up and down the lake. And the kids swapped around and went to explore islands it was really good. The weather helped it was scorching.

 me her Dad had just had his first calf since FMD and so he was really happy. He had 2 holdings which were run as one. He managed to keep his heifers which were on the second holding. Probably because they were the last ones in the area, and these were th
e ones that were now calving. He still blames the pyre from a neighbour for spreading the virus to his farm.

after having come back from the Belgian blue inspections to help out at surgery. The inspections were fun, but it gave me the creeps being in the mart and inspecting mouths as it brought back bad memories. The mart is ridiculously clean, and the last time
 I inspected mouths was for FMD, after shooting a herd that was a dangerous contact. I was trying to persuade {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 4}}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}

Day off. Spent the morning fixing the shower drainage, which had suffered from one too many footballs being kicked against it. The problem was the broken part was also a metric to imperial converter.( One end was 40mm and the oth
er was 43mm) Which once I discovered that was what I needed meant a trip to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 4}}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 0}}}Carlisle{\*\xmlclose}
 as nowhere in Wigton had it. So it got codged up with plenty of silicone!! 
\par The afternoon was spent going to visit }{\fs24\insrsid16020834 [prisoner]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278 . He is the friend who stabbed his wife\rquote s boyfriend in Wigton, and so he is currently residing at Her Majesty\rquote 
s Pleasure in Durham Prison. It was a very disheartening experience. As with any organisation, it takes time to work out where to go and what you need to get through the hoops. I went from
 one part of the prison to another and backwards and forwards. The staff where very friendly and helpful, but they are all at fixed stations and so you are sent from one area to another. The security, although expected and natural, still comes as a bit of
 
a shock. Photographed in, and issued with a barcode to get you in and out. And you put all your belongings in a locker before you are allowed in. Of course I did not realise that you only need the ID (Passport) to get your bar code so I kept it to show at
 the entrance. Where all I needed was the bar code. So they sent me back to put it in the locker. 
\par }{\fs24\insrsid16020834 [prisoner]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  was Ok, but he is still finding it hard to think about a future that does not include his wife. Even though the divorce papers are filed, and he has done
 some pretty nasty things to her and the boyfriend. He is pleading guilty and is expecting to go down for a good few years. 
\par The whole visitors area was charged with emotion, with people coming to see brothers, husbands, lovers. There were lots of girls wi
th young children coming to see their Dads. I felt very sad for them and for the kids who are growing up with out a Dad, or the stigma of a Dad in jail. 
\par }{\fs24\insrsid16020834 [His]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278 
 kids have written but he is realistic. His wife is very anti him, and they are unlikely to keep up with him in the long term, as she at best, is not going to be supportive, at worst is going to try to dissuade them.
\par He was quite upset about that. He is a
lso not able to sort out his things, or see his house before it is sold. He did a lot of building work etc on it and has an emotional attachment to it. But there is no real closure. He had emotional problems before all this. He is likely to have even more
 on his release. His car on which there is still a car loan has been removed from the pound but he doesn\rquote t know where it is.

\par The day was great to start with headed down to Iselgate to see a lame bul
l to give it a certificate. They are still suffering from both the financial and emotional scars of FMD. Mind you they were always odd. She was talking about the isolation that was hard to break out of, and get back in to doing things again. They were als
o hoping to retire when they were 50 but BSE hit, so they decided to keep on and had no income from Jan to October last year. Mind you they would only usually be selling stores any way.
\par The day was taking a turn for the worse when after sorting out umpteen decisions for the practice manager on organisational issues he said \'93 wasn\rquote t it easy when you were just being a vet???\'94 
\par Fatal mistake as the next dog to be seen was an odd ball. It had woken up that morning after being perfectly ok up til then. It had gr
owled at tis owner and he had decided to leave it for a while. After an hour or so he went to get it up out of its bed and it flew at him and as he put it meant it. So he rang up and brought it to the vets. This change of behaviour meant he had put it in 
a
 kennel and left it. So when I went in to examine it growled and flapped its ears at me and bit at the bars. Some dogs in pain or fear will growl or let you know that it is not happy, but this one meant it. We had a go at trying to get it examined by usin
g the dog catcher and muzzles, but it mean it.
\par Left it to settle down over lunch but it was worse. Finally got it sedated, it had a temp of 104. Injected mm, and so was a case of encephalitis with rage. So after 3 vets all looking at it and umming and errin
g we decided to get a MAFF vet to have a look just to check that it wasn\rquote 
t rabies. I had forgotten that none of them are clinical or able to handle animals but it was a bit of a joke. But as there was no history with it, of contact with abroad it has been left alive for the time being.
\par But the stress of both handling the dam thing and the worry of is it rabid and the consequences was some what tiring so I am washed out tonight.

, so stock taking which for me includes mucking out my car. I thought it was quite normal to take the wheelie bin to the car and just hoy the cont
ents in until my neighbour saw one of the rare occasions when it happens and burst out laughing. He found it quite amusing. I was a bit taken a back at the time but we always assume what we do is normal!
\par The open day was OK but }{\fs24\insrsid10313242 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  was out so had to juggle things a bit. I was On call so late finished, and had to fetch }{\fs24\insrsid16020834 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278 
 from football as his practice had been shifted to Tuesdays with the dark nights. So I owe }{\fs24\insrsid16020834 [friend]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  a bottle of wine for turning up half an hour late to pick him up. The boiler man arrived at

\par Had several interesting conversations on FMD. The most amusing one was about Tony Blair arranging his bust up with unions on the anniversary of the FMD out break finishing so as to keep it out the news. 
\par The same farmer said about the govts response the countryside alliance March. The fact that they have reduced the sparsity factor in the allocation of central funds to  local authorities. This means that those with a l
ower population density and therefore a higher perceived  cost  of providing services are going to have this downgraded. Or in this farmer\rquote s opinion take money from the countryside to the town. Don\rquote 
t march or this govt will kick you where it hurts in a very subtle way.
\par The other one was probably more relevant in that in a group discussion, admittedly fuelled by an intake of free alcohol. Several were saying that this year was harder to cope with than last as there was no crisis or adrenalin to keep them goi
ng. And that the toll from last year was beginning to tell on them and their nerves. Two were still under court threats from Trading Standards /DEFRA for not complying with regulations. Both will in my opinions not result in anything but they are pretty p
issed off to put it mildly.
\par There is also a real antagonism to doing the testing for ministry and we are in the cross fire as Defra vets decide what is to be done and yet we are the ones trying to arrange and get the testing done. While they do not have to 
pay us, they do have to spend a fair chunk of time organising and actually getting the job done. We are having a real problem with organising the testing on one of the common grazings. There are 14 farmers with animals on it. Biosecurity is a joke when yo
ur animals are on common grazing with 14 others. And trying to get 2 farmers to agree on a date and a method of doing it. They all have different ideas, and most do not want so and so there co he \lquote ll just wind the cattle up, and we\rquote 
ll never catch them.!!!

 brother onwards. I always meant to go back and fill in the days that I missed but never made the time or the effort. I found the time very difficult. So how her parents and sister-in-law coped I do not know. The funeral was at Kir
by and I am pleased that I went. It was very sad to see some one in the prime of their life with so much to offer, cut down in such a random way. It was a very Cumbrian farming gathering. The red faced craggy farmers, and yet there was a friend of the fam
ily who sang at the wedding who was a black American gospel singer. The global village or world wide family of the church, take your pick.
\par The death of some one young always makes you consider your own mortality and makes you think about what you are doing. Will you on your death bed wish that you had made different choices??
\par The next month was busy and stressful, and probably a time which would have been useful for the study to have thoughts and reactions to my life when under stress, but I suppose to a cer

 But if the cattle had not been culled, there would have been no blood sampling to do and no reason to be on the road that day at that time. Linkage is not the way to go. He may have had to go to feed stock or he could have been in an accident in
 another way. But the ripples of actions continue to reverberate around.

\rquote t. I was focussed on what I was trying to do, as usual. So up the ladder I went, to connect up the light, not knowing that }{\fs24\insrsid10313242 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278 
 had switched the electrics back on. And yes when I was at the top of the ladder, I grabbed the wires, and then spent what seemed
 an awfully long time trying to let them go and stay on the ladder as the electric current was shocking me.  So the light did not get fixed as I was not going back up the ladder as I was now in shock. !!

There seem to be a lot of problems (Still) on restocking farms. They are all having problems with getting the cows back in calf. Two farm
s today complained that even though they were more than pleased with the compensation at the time, the costs of restocking are much, much more.  It would be interesting to do a survey on the number of breeding animals bought in and those who have been los
t either through illness or by failure to get in calf. 
\par The old diseases are still causing the most problems. Lung worm, a disease I thought was well under control, and well understood has caused huge problems. IBR or cow flu has caused so many problems tha
t we can no longer get the vaccine, as all the stocks have been used.
\par It was interesting today that one of the farms that is about to start milking having finally restocked ordered vaccine for Lepto, IBR, and BVD almost as a matter of course.

 million , the last quarter was 10 times that. So there is money being spent.
\par The priorities of Govts is often difficult to work out. The Indian govt doesn't have enough money at the local level to organise a proper refuse collection system. Yet has money to develop hi tech weaponry!
\par The attitudes to rubbish here is very different. When we were at the beach, the actual beach is combed
 by litter pickers, but the areas in between are terrible. There are 2 smart 4* hotels and the govt buildings where the tourism training takes place. The grounds are immaculate and the flowers and area beautiful but once out side the grounds it is a cross
 between a rubbish dump and a building site with piles of rubbish and sand and rubble.
\par We went for a snorkelling trip around the coast to a fishing harbour  where the sea was calm and there were plenty of rocks for the fish to hide in, and swim in and out of.
\par The boats were a few bits of wood tied together with string. Seriously.
\par There were two central planks and two edge planks and then an aft piece of wood to hold the aft part together which was reinforced by cord. The  wood is so light that it floats with
 our weight fairly easily. The oars were split bamboo with no grips, so it made for interesting rowing or is it paddling? They are more like large Canadian canoes than boats. 
\par Very {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 4}}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 0}}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 4}}

\par The planks were roughly shaped but as we rode the waves the water fountained up through the holes in the bottom. H asked what wood they were made of but didn't understand the answer, must be a type of balsa.
\par  We set off  from under the light house, there was another group going at the same time. I think they must have agreed to pay top whack, whereas you
\par soon learn to try to bargain about the price of everything here. They had two helpers in the boat to paddle whereas we were the economy class with two paddles but only one guide in our two boats!! We took turns in 
helping to paddle, whether we made much difference to the progression of the boat I don 't know; but it was fun. It was a bit worrying that we were heading for the least scenic part of the coast.(The other way is beautiful sandy beaches for miles) 
\par 
\par There 
is a wave powered generator at the edge of the harbour, a  few rusty wrecks and bits of broken concrete. But when we arrived the snorkelling was brilliant. It was like swimming in a tropical fish tank. My favourite were small electric blue fish which dart
ed away as soon as you came near. There were big black and yellow striped tiger fish. There were 2 sorts one with vertical stripes and one with horizontal. Not at all timid.
\par The angel fish with their long dangling barbs were shy and would only appear when you kept still. There were some very large spiky sea anemones as big as a football. Loads of crabs and shoals of fish which swim hither and thither.
\par Some were quite bizarre. There were some that looked like sea horses that had been straightened out. You almost could see a jockey getting a saddle ready to put on them for the Saltwater Derby. The huge variety and colours were just outstanding.
\par We spent a few hours and then got thoroughly sun burnt on the way back. The boys had been full of beans on the way there but were exhausted in the heat on the way back.
\par We spent today making and flying kites on top of a hill at Pykara. The kids(or was it t
he Dad's ?) made kites and then we tried to fly them. H's won. His design was copied from an original no stick design and managed to fly almost successfully. My traditional kite shaped one flew once but its aerodynamics weren't quite right. }{

quare was successful. None however matched the Ikea bought one. We played cricket and Frisbee as the water buffalos wandered passed in the typical Indian way of having no real boundaries between one thing and another. Called in at the Vedera's which was v
ery pleasant. The garden was stunning as usual. I love driving through the tea plantations with acres of terraced tea plants and through the forest to get there.
\par  The hotel is an up market Indian rather than a western. Which is great for us. The d\'e9cor lacks a little in taste and design. Concrete floors and that rather quaint unfinished look. Spotlessly clean, and the thing about {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname

children is always a bit stressful, as low blood sugars combined with the general attitude of people to children does not make it a pleasant experience. Whereas even the hours wait for the food here is not stressful as the kids wander off, play games read

\fs24\insrsid11042402 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  won a little elephant off him by beating him at chess. }{\fs24\insrsid11042402 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  decided he would buy Josh the chess set, and kept bargaining the price down. He eventually paid

\par 350 rupees for it. $4.60.
\par The beach is idyllic, with palm trees and warm rolling sea. The only problem is having to get the kids out of the sun during the red hot period between 12 and 2 . We do keep slapping on the sun ta
n lotion. I missed the widows peaks where my hair is receding and have sun burnt red patches either side of my head. The boys have variable tanning, depending on where the sun block was washed off first!

\par Just a quick note to say that we are enjoying ourselves so much that we don't want to come home......But we would miss all our friends!!
\par We had a great time at the beach, you know the palm trees, the warm rolling sea, the sandy beaches and unlike Silloth 30 degrees warmth. In fact som
e days it was to hot, and we had to drag the boys out of the sea or else they would have been really sun burnt.
\par We are just back from 3 days at Avalanche, which is a bit of an unfortunate name for a mountain out door centre, but as there isn't any snow I don't think the Indians appreciate the irony.
\par It is up in the Mountains, a jungle area where there is very little apart from a few tea plantations, reservoirs and hydroelectric plants, and jungle and the wood men who harvest the wood every 10 years.
\par We left
 a bus and walked in to the centre, while a truck took the bags, food and the lazy ones. It is incredibly beautiful with high hills and lakes, but there is a drought at the moment so the  reservoirs are all very low. And everywhere is incredibly dry and d
usty. Thick red dust, which gets in to everything. The facilities were basic. The water ran from a stream to a tank to the taps!! No electric, showers but fortunately as always in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour

 so we are not hanging around the airport for ages. Having 4 children and going through the bureaucracy of an Indian airport is bad enough with out the additional hassle of waiting around for 3 hours with out reas

gs are the same, but I suppose you have changed, and the old certainties, that were not certain but seemed it, have made way for new changeable ways that are not certain and you know that they are not certain.

 from certain countries as long as you meet the conditions. We have had a few problems and we do very few. So what it must be like for those on the south coast I dread to think. The problems are 2 main on
es. 1.That there is a 6 month period before you can come back into the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 4}}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 0}}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1

 after the paper work is completed. You can go before the 6 months, so people who spend the summer on a caravan site, will take their dog abroad, but cannot come back before the 6 mon
th date. There is also a problem where the forms have to be renewed. It has to be done according to the manufactures directions, which vary from country to country. As in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}

 dogs have to be done every 2 years, cats annually. So you cannot have your documentation renewed in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 4}}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 0}}}

\par }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 There is a real problem with cow fertility in the restocking farms at the moment. I went to
 1 farm where of the 10 cows I checked only one was in calf. Which is a little sad. No baby calves, no milk production and more losses for the FMD farmers. The compensation is looking very small. The only ones  who benefited are those who took the money a

\par It is difficult trying to work out why these cows are having so much of a problem. As usual I suspect there is no simple answer. The blood tests and analyses do not help much. The cows have been under a lot of stress. The movement into new regim

als to a herd there are lead cows who know the set up and cows are very much follow my leader in their behaviour patterns. Where there is a complete cull and restocking there are no lead cows so no leader for the cows to follow.

The more I experience the legal proceedings the more I feel that they are a waste of time. What is important is how good your lawyer is. The case was all about whether or not this guy had starved his greyhounds or not. He ha
d, but as he was on legal aid he thought it might be better to try to keep his other dogs. And have fewer judgements against him. He obviously knew his way around the legal system.

\par It is one of those really annoying things that you can never replay what has happened.
\par The case yesterday really churned me up with having to make huge moral decisions more or less on the spur of the moment. 
\par The complicating factors were that C}{\fs24\insrsid7883633  }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 who was acting on the defence was acting outside the RCVS guidelines. Now I could have pointed out this to the RSPCA lawyer, but as C}{\fs24\insrsid7883633  }{
\fs24\insrsid3294278 has already been struck off once the matter could well have turned very badly for him. Even though it is his decision to get involved and a poor one.
 Then I think that it is not for me to land him in the muck, I could have done so both on the fact he should not have been speaking and also that I could have pointed out that his record is tainted. Why he was being an expert witness in the first place fo
r some one who is not even their client beadsmen (? Beats me)
\par . I had reservations about doing the legal work for the RSPCA, and at least we do quite a lot of work for the local inspector.
\par So I decided not to trash C}{\fs24\insrsid7883633  }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 as a witness as I thought that it wa
s not my place to do so, and secondly the repercussions for local vet good will would not stand me in good stead. But I have my doubts as to whether I did the correct thing. There is no right and wrong. The dilemmas are there because you to choose which h
orn you want to get impaled on.

Lambing seems to have started with a vengeance spent most of the morning at the surgery, with land rovers and trailers turning up one after another. With sheep lambing or having peri-natal problems. I do like working out
 of the surgery at the w/e, as there is far less driving and working is so much easier and you don\rquote t have to keep getting changed in and out of protective clothes.
\par So got two vets work done by just keeping on asking for them to come to the surgery. The farmers don\rquote 
t mind either as they generally have to put them in a pick up to bring them back to the farm from the field so it is as easy to drive on to the vets rather than hang around waiting for them.

Spent the morning  doing certs. These are OTM22 certificates which were brought in b
y MAFF to compensate the farmer for cows that would have been sold for human consumption before the OTM scheme banned them from human consumption. If an animal is not fit to travel then it can be shot on the farm, but to get the compensation they need a v
et\rquote s cert to say that it is fit for human consumption, so it can be burnt on the scheme. If it is not fit then they have to pay to have it taken away. So there is a lot of pressure to sign them.
\par The scheme is supposed to be coming to an end this summer but 
as yet no markets exist for the casualty animals that are fir for human consumption. The whole knackery/ injured animals/ burying of animals scheme is up for grabs and the govt needs to get some sort of scheme up and running. But the govt thinks, maybe ri
ghtly that it is an industry problem to get rid of its own waste and it is not up to the taxpayer to get farmers waste problems sorted. Leave it up to the industry/ market to sort it.
\par There is also a suggestion that as TB is not an important zoonosis in the
 UK anymore then it is a production problem and it should go the same way as sheep scab and be taken off the notifiable disease list and individual farms have to ensure they meet whatever standard that the buyers want to specify. Which is what is happenin
g to a small extent in the dairy industry with buyers specifying farms must meet certain criteria.

 always forget is that they are usually working off either a single or 3-4 samples of silage so that there will be a spread of what is actually in the silage and the samples may or may not reflect it.

. And a consequence of FMD that you forget about. There is an inherited genetic condition of Suffolk\rquote 
s called Dandy-walker syndrome causing hydrocephalus in the lambs. So both the ewe and tup must carry the gene to produce the deformed lambs with heads too
 large to get through the mothers pelvis. So it means doing a caesarean on a ewe that can only be used to breed fat lambs from. It has to be put to another breed next year. This years lambs are dead/ going to die. So the economics are useless. Some breede
rs just shoot them at this point. But he had called us to try to lamb it or caesaer it. As she was a big ewe I eventually managed to lamb it. 
\par He was saying though that it takes time to work out whether the stock you have bought will produce the breeding st
ock that you want. You have to try the different combinations that you have to work out which lines work well together. He reckons on about 4-8 years before he will be back to breeding decent Suffolk sheep in spite of buying in good stock. There is more t
o breeding than meets the eye.

Tried to sort out some of the Tracings that we are supposed to be doing. There are a lot coming through but the quality 
of the info is very poor. Tracings are where the farm has sold animals and then subsequently gone down with TB or other notifiable disease. The DEFRA paper chase is so bad that ear tag nos are wrong or a farmer has bought several from the same source and 
only 1-2 are on the paper work from DEFRA. The thing seems to be falling apart a bit. 
\par Went and did a single animal up at the mill. He usually buys in stores and fattens them. But As the store trade has gone through the roof he has sold a lot of them on to 
let some one else fatten or if heifers breed from them. The DEFRA files have him as a fattening unit/ finisher so that they hadn\rquote

\par On a sunny weekend at the beginning of March, over 70 vets, vet students and families bravely took time out of their busy schedules and gathered expectantly at The Hayes conference centre in Derbyshire f
or the 2003 VCF conference. We were a mixed bunch, ranging in age from 2 months to 70 (well, nearly), from many different places, denominations and walks of veterinary life, but we all had a common goal in mind: to unite in our desire to love and serve th
e Lord Jesus Christ in the vocation to which He has called us and to encourage one another to be "salt and light" in the veterinary world.
\par \~Our distinguished speaker for the weekend was Dr. }{\fs24\insrsid15482858 L}{\fs24\insrsid3294278 , a consultant psychiatrist and Christian who drew from hi
s own experience to bring us some thoughtful insights on the subject of "God at Work". He emphasised the fact that although work is a godly activity and that we should view whatever we do "as if working for the Lord" (Colossians {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 4}}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 0}}}3:18{\*\xmlclose}) it must not be forgot
ten that a balance must be achieved between work, church, family life etc. There was also an opportunity to discuss how we would respond as Christians to a variety of ethical decisions that commonly present themselves in veterinary practice.
\par \~As well as the main talks there was the opportunity to join a variety of seminars on relevant practical subjects. }{\fs24\insrsid15482858 BT}{\fs24\insrsid3294278 , a vet and long-serving missionary in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}

gelistic work in a different culture. Students and new graduates were well provided for in seminars on "practicing reality" - living out one's faith in the university or veterinary practice environment. M C bravely stepped in at short notice to lead a sem
inar on business ethics, and vcf secretary generated some thought-provoking discussion on a very relevant subject for many - singleness. 
\par \~It was not all work and no play, however, and we were much obliged to the Scottish students for organising the Saturday night ceilidh. Much fun was had by all.
\par So, we all parted company on Sunday feeling refreshed and well-fed both physically and spiritually. How encouraging to be reminded that you are not the only Christian vet out there, and that there are ma
ny others who grapple with the same issues you face. The weekend was a time of friendships rekindled and hopefully new ones made, a time of strengthening and a reminder of what is ultimately the most important thing in our busy lives.

\par So we went forward to where she was. Without warning, or snorting or given it a second thought she charged, caught me under the ribs with her head and threw me to the ground. Before I could react she butted me again in the head, snorted kicked me, and the

ght on the one hand while shouting for help from the other guys. One came back with a pitchfork. As I was on the ground I kicked her again. As they came with the fork and let go and scrambled away around the box she still came after me, but I got to the g

w
as in pain and had probably just got herself really wound up. But she almost killed me. I then sat having strong tea for quarter of an hour before summoning up the courage to drive home. With hind sight, I should have taken up there offer of a) Getting so

\par }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 Next year I am NOT going it is definitely some one else\rquote s turn.
\par I speak of the annual training (????) day for senior LVIs. It just drives me up the wall. The morning was spent fairly usefully talking about contingency planning for the next FMD or exotic disease epidemic. The }{\fs24\insrsid2716255 P}{
\fs24\insrsid3294278 age St planners seemed fairly well clued in and taking on board a lot of the ideas and problems that had been seen in 2001.
\par The afternoon was then totally depressing.
\par TB is now endemic in the south of the county, there was a deer herd that had animals dying and so took them to the VIC lab at Penrith to find out why they had these animals losing weight and dying. Th
ey had TB. The ministry had known that there had been reactors all around that area but had never picked up on the fact these deer were here and should have been tested.
\par There were also complaints that forward tracings were not being done on some cattle. T
o which the Vety Officer giving the talk said it was quite difficult to work out where cattle had gone. This was met with some incredulity by the local vets as the paperwork and computerised passport scheme surely means that \'93trace-ability\'94
 was one of the BIG issues to do with BSE, and if it cannot be done it means the whole thing is a useless sham.
\par Well the answer is that you can trace a specific animal through markets and holdings but not animals on and off a holding.
\par So tracings are taking too much time.
\par So it is not getting done so TB is spreading.
\par IDIOTS
\par 
\par The best systems, the best tools, the best ideas, the best businesses have to work through people.
\par So next year some one else can go and listen to the plans in the sky.
\par This was the meeting where we had an excellent talk on FMD in Feb 2000. Just a pity they did not listen to their own experts.
\par There was also a talk on the new Scrapie scheme where the guy speaking knew less than his audience???  Why???
\par I have to go back to the speaker at the VCF w/e who 
said that when he came out of Medical school he Had spent 6 years being taught to be rational and scientific, where disease was discussed logically and a rational conclusion was sought. He came with the same idea to the National Health Service and struggl
ed. He said\'94
.. we live in a fallen world with fallen institutions, and we have to accept that at times they do not make sense, and that it is not in our power or capabilities to change them. Where we can we change them where we cannot we work within them\'94

\par 
\par If we cannot trace from herds with tuberculosis reactors, the ability to track FMD is obviously a non starter.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 Haven\rquote t got the workload right at all. I think the sunshine has sent the farmers into the fields to work and the lambs and calves are all arriving un aided in to the sunshine. It is amazing h
ow the good weather makes you feel so much better. So I have booked in extra testing for next week. 
\par The only slightly sad thing was talking to one of the farmers who had just started lambing. I was taking out rotten lambs that were aborting 2 weeks earlie
r. It is his first season actually lambing as he only bought in fat sheep last year. He said that it was at this stage 2 years ago that they came and took all his sheep. He should not have let them do it. It was wrong and he had not put up a fight. He had
 
just gone along with it. He was fairly melancholic about it. I tried to point out that every one had done it, and it had seemed to be best thing to do at the time. I did not think that pointing out I had not been convinced and argued against it, and that 
o
nly 2 out of 10,000 blood samples of live sheep slaughtered had been exposed to the virus would have helped. They were my granddads flock, he said. Now we have all these problems he says. Looking at the dead lambs I have just pulled out: lying in a heap i
n the corner of the trailer. You never forget something like that lad he says never.
\par There are a lot of anniversaries to go through and all the farmers are saying the fun has gone out of it.

\par 
\par I have also been reading the DEFRA contingency plan and a lot of lessons do seem to have been learnt. I appreciate this years deadline has been passed to place it before parliament, but it is a \'93living\'94 document! 
\par My apologies but better late than never!!!
\par 
\par  I would like to make a few comments as one of the early TVI volunteers at {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 4}}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 0}}}Carlisle{\*\xmlclose}
, and as a partner of one of the practices at the eye of the storm.
\par 
\par 1. The whole issue of valuation of animals taken as a compulsory purchase by the state for the benefit
 of the farming community to eradicate disease, has not been addressed. One of the initial problems slowing the slaughter of infected animals was the valuation. My own view then and now is that a simple standard valuation must be applied. It must be high 
e
nough to be an incentive to reporting  of disease, but too low to make the possibility of disease seem financially attractive. The price for compulsory purchase may be set higher for dangerous contacts or  less for affected  animals. If there is a simple 
s
tandard value, then the diagnosing vet counts the number of bovines and shoots them. The farmer knows in advance what compensation is going to be paid, and individual animals of high merit could be insured for whatever sum the farmer is willing to pay pre
miums for. This may be an unpopular nettle but it needs to be grasped, even though I am sure my clients would disapprove of it.
\par \tab The current tuberculosis problems are again high lighting the problems in this area. There should be a standard procedure and va
luation for all notifiable diseases, and the values based on the last mid market rate. There are apocryphal stories that the valuers are still running the system for their clients the farmers, not DEFRA.
\par 
\par 2. The second issue that has not been addressed is the tracings system.
\par With the advent of the British Cattle Movement Services, I was under the impression that \'93traceability\'94  was a central part of government policy. It was with some incredulity that in response to questioning at the LVI meeting we were t
old that BCMS cannot give a list of movements on or off a holding. So tracings for TB are still being done by a DEFRA vet trawling through a farmers movement book. Why? If the political will was there, at the touch of a bottom the data base should be able
 to generate a list of animals moved in the past 6 months, which markets they have been through, and which holdings they have been through. If this cannot be done for TB, you can forget trying to do it for FMD or other fast contagious disease.
\par }\pard\plain \s19\ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {\insrsid3294278 There is stil
l a confusion over the database which should be based on holding numbers. Several farmers have multiple holding numbers, several have a single holding number and multiple sites. High genetic merit animals may have several owners, a single holding may have
 stock from several different farms. The rules for CPH numbers need to be re-evaluated centrally.  If a data base is to be of use it must be actively managed and updated. That can only be done at a local level.

\par 3. Disposal
\par I know that this has been looked 
at, but farm sizes are continuing to grow at an ever more rapid rate. The average size of dairy farms in this area has grown by 20 cows since FMD. This means there will be a bigger disposal problem as individual farms will have more and more stock.
\par 
\par 4.\'94 The local office should have stores to equip 20 TVIs}{\cs23\fs24\super\insrsid3294278 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s22\ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0

\par We touched on this point at the meeting was the need for sudden recruitment of TVI or other veterinary staff. While the SVS can second small numbers of
 vets for short term availability, there was a reluctance by some DVMs to second staff who may yet be required in their own areas. Local LVIs can provide veterinary cover but the whole structure of large animal practice is in flux, and it may or may not b
e
 possible to provide veterinary inspections on an allocated, on a  temporary or part time basis. The pay and conditions for such assistance need addressed and agreed. The other part of this is orientation/ training at the local levels. This by the end of 
the outbreak at Carlisle, was quite impressive. However has that information been put together centrally? Should there be a central trainer who trains designated trainers for each SVS office/DECC?
\par Similarly with lay blood samplers/ vaccinators. Again local 
practices could provide nominated nurses/ lay staff for training. During the out break here AI personnel were used very effectively  for blood sampling and other procedures. Is this again something for the local plan? But if  the cost for training AI staf
f in blood sampling was met centrally it would encourage  a register of trained personnel to be maintained locally.
\par  The Cumbria County Council Inquiry recommends the use of  its emergency centre as a hub for multi agency response to any disease out break. 
 Should there be some joined up government so that each county council as part of its contingency plan provides for an admin back up for any emergency, civil disaster, terrorist incident?? And do the local plans make use of this??
\par 
\par My main concern, however, is that when I asked at that meeting had the two way communications between Page St and Carlisle been sorted out\'85..it was met by nervous laughter.
\par 
\par I would like to emphasise that Page St did not know what was going on in the field during FMD outbreak. There was a communication barrier between the vets in the field and Carlisle management, and a huge gulf between Carlisle and Page Street.  
\par 
\par I would plead that this is addressed as the culture identified by Iain Anderson still seems to prevail. I quote  \'93a 
culture predisposed to decision making by committee with an associated fear of personal risk taking. Such a climate does not encourage creative initiative. It inhibits adaptive behaviour, and organisational learning which over time lowers the quality of t
he decisions taken. It seems to me that a reappraisal of prevailing attitudes and behaviours within the Department would be beneficial.\'94 *
\par 
\par It may be outside your remit but the Northumberland report with its flow charts and recommendations, actually lists lessons to be learned in Dec 1969. The one about the SVS who fared so poorly in FMD 2001 states\'85 \'93
We have considered the recruitment problem of the State Veterinary Service\'85the reasons maybe the low initial salary or in part the to the nature of the duties within the Service\'85
..We consider it important for future development that the Ministry of Agriculture should attract a greater number of good young graduates willing to make a career in the service.\'94#
\par 
\par At the end of any p
lan are the people who are going to implement it. They need well managed, well led and given the resources to carry out the task. They need to have confidence in both the political and civil service leadership. There will need to be a risk management of t
asks for financial reasons, resource reasons and for the wider rural economy. This requires flexible decision makers who are prepared to take risks and stick their head above the collective parapet.

\par The day ended with the reading of a TB test on a farm that was hoping to become clear after going down when it first restocked 18months ago. 1 reactor and 1 I/R on normal interpretation. They will probably take both on severe interpretation.

s sister quite well and I always make sure I tell her how much the good lunch is appreciated. So there builds up a rivalry between them as to who can provide th

 along the A595 as it has a really bad record for car accidents. The numbers killed continues to go up. The speed cameras are in a van, which can move around and hence trap the speeders. It is called Casualty Reduction Unit\'85

\par Welcome to Hebron Evangelical church this Easter Sunday morning when we are celebrating Jesus is alive.  Our opening hymn is our declaration that Jesus is alive he has risen from the dead.
\par 
\par Opening Hymn: We believe in God the Father
\par Welcome; Intro me and welcome team. 
\par This morning the service is in a different order from usual. We are going to remember what Jesus has done for us on the cross and Bruce Beattie, one of our elders is going to help explain what the bread and wine mean to us as some of the children may not 
have been here for a communion service before .
\par 
\par Then after taking communion we are going to celebrate Jesus\rquote  resurrection \'85 with reading, singing and sharing. The resurrection is the central part to our faith. Who knows what that long word \'93resurrection\'94 means?? 
\par 
\par }{\fs24\cf2\insrsid3294278 The answers from the kids were quite amusing but we got there in the end!!
\par }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 At the end of the service there will be the offering, an opportunity to give our money as well as ourselves to the living God.
\par 
\par If during the service the young children get fed up there is a place at the back where they can do some making things\'85It isn\rquote t easy to sit still when you are little or be quiet! So please don\rquote 
t worry about the little ones being a distraction. I often wonder what it was like when Jesus fed the 5000plus crowd. Do you think the children all sat neat and quiet in rows. I don\rquote t think so!! 
\par We are pleased to see them and hear them. This is a time of family worship from the youngest to the oldest.

\par It is my opinion that clinical farm animal practice, the examining and diagnosing of individual animals is already uneconomic for both the veterinary surgeon and the farmer. It is only happening because of the cross subsidy of the professional fees by oth
er income, and because of the good will of most farmers to give animals a chance.
\par As the harsh economics are coming home to vets and farmers this is rapidly becoming; with James Herriot, a part of rural history.

\par What are the current trends within agriculture and veterinary practice and what effects will that have?
\par 
\par Both in agriculture and farm veterinary practice there are trends that can be identified, how fast, how far these trends will g
o is difficult to predict, but my own experience is that change when it comes, change is often slow at starting but then dramatic in its speed. The effect of decoupling and other EU decisions on agriculture are unknown but the current trends are likely to
 continue.
\par In agriculture farm size has to continue to grow. As farms make less and less per animal, they have to spread costs over larger and larger numbers. The individual value of each animal continues to drop in real terms, efficiency and mechanisation 
continues to increase. Chicken farms are now routinely 100,000 animals plus. Since foot and mouth disease the average dairy herd size has increased from 90 to 114 an increase of 20% which talking to many dairy farmers is only going to increase as more her
ds are going to be 300+ animals. These increases are usually with out an increase in labour on the farms. This means the care of individual animals is likely to be less important, but the care of the overall heath of the herd much more. 
\par 
\par In veterinary practice  the major changes are likely to be from the Competition Inquiry in to the cost of pharmaceuticals. The subsidy of professional fees by sales of pharmaceuticals has been an increasing trend since the late 60\rquote 
s. Then professional fees were subsidised by the large-scale eradication schemes by MAFF who paid very good fees to get the vets on the farm and  help eradicate the Notifiable Diseases. 
\par The competition inquiry is recommending that pharmaceuticals be dispensed by pharmacies as well and that prescri
ptions be provided free of charge. Which private organisation is going to provide a service free of charge has yet to be ascertained, but the current level of income derived from pharmaceuticals is not going to be sustained. This inevitably means that the
 cross subsidy will disappear and farmers will have to pay the full cost of veterinary clinical service, and it will not be economic to do so.
\par 
\par At the same time the costs of providing veterinary services continues to rise.
\par The cost of veterinary time is continuing to rise. Students are now graduating with debts of \'a315-20K because of the loss of grants and payment of tuition fees. This means there will need to be a further raise of \'a3
2-3K per annum to pay veterinary assistants to match the status quo. Farm animal practice already  pays assistants less than companion animal practices despite offering a less favourable \'93On Call\'94 rota.
\par  In the short term following FMD many practice principals worked additional On Call to make the rota acceptable to attract assista
nt vets. Where this is viable in the short term, in the long term it is not acceptable. As partners profit  becomes commensurate to the salaries they have to pay to veterinary assistants they will be aiming to increase charges for clinical work or look to
 other avenues for decreasing costs/increasing turnover.
\par 
\par  Providing an out of hours emergency cover is not economically practical for vets. (except in the big cities where practices join together to provide an emergency clinic.) Currently there is an RCVS 
obligation to provide 24hour cover, but the RCVS is not involved in the commercial pricing of services. 
\par As the value of individual animals continues to drop in real terms then the cost of treating individual animals becomes less and less viable. Where there is no cross subsidy for out of hours work it will become untenable.
\par 
\par As many mixed practices have a dwindling farm animal side that is less financially attractive, many will decide to concentrate on the companion animal side of the business.
\par 
\par 
\par In a lot 
of mixed practices, it is a senior partner who will do the largest amount of the farm work. This means the younger vets will not have the case load to become experienced and confident in farm work. There is a cohort of practitioners in this situation head
ing towards retirement in the near future, will the practice continue to be involved with farm work?
\par  As fewer practices become involved with farm veterinary services, the cost of travel to the more distant farms has to rise beyond the already accelerated rate.
\par 
\par All this means that farm veterinary practices will lose income from clinical services and from pharmaceutical sales. They will have to move more towards the pig/ poultry model of providing veterinary advice and charging for it.

Vets have already moved out of nutritional advice leaving this field to nutritional experts. The reason for this is that most nutritional advice is provided \'93free\'94
 to the farmer by the firms who then put that cost into the feeds that are sold to the farmers. This cross subsidy of fees by sales is apparently acceptable where the subsidy of veterinary fees by pharmaceuticals is not.
\par This model is beginning to appear in other areas. Whereas vets provided most mastitis control, the dairies who buy the milk are now providing \'93free\'94
 or subsidised advice to farms on cell counts and high bacterial counts. (Including bacteriology with a variable back up and quality of advice)

\par As the number of clinical veterinarians reduces then there will be much less on farm surveillance. 
\par This means that outbreaks of novel or unusual diseases is much less likely to be noticed or recorded at an early stage.
\par  The routine care for the animals will be done by stockmen under veterinary guidance. 
\par The guidance will probably be by quarterly  or 6 monthly or annual  visits and by herd health plans.
\par  Individual animals are much more likely to be tr
eated ad hoc by the stockmen, rather than by veterinary surgeons.  The quality of this treatment in some cases may be adequate but in most will be poor. The significance of symptoms or illness may not be appreciated. Diagnosis and treatment seen as a high
 cost and used as a last resort. Any outbreak of disease will be well developed and losses occurring before veterinary advice is sought. 
\par 
\par As herd sizes increase and labour decreases, then the attention to individual animals must reduce, with a drop in welfare standards. 
\par Ill animals are likely to be culled quicker, as limited manpower becomes more important. The use of vets as additional expert man power for calvings/ lambings will be seen as too expensive.
\par 
\par The demands of the system must mean that high heath status is important, with routine vaccination and herd health policies being put in place. 
\par DEFRA seems to set high regard to laboratory diagnosis results as a form of surveillance. Most of the common problems are diagnosed/treated with out the resort t
o laboratory aids. Fertility, lameness, mastitis, pneumonia, PGE, are rarely referred to the lab except where treatment is not working.  Most samples are taken/referred by vets in practice. Fewer vets would mean fewer samples.
\par The lack of veterinary advice to ill pigs and ill sheep on farms at Heddon-on\endash the-Wall shows how the lack of a clinical veterinary service can lead to in the terms of delay and spread of disease.
\par  The local knowledge of the current LVI system is an invaluable asset that is in danger of being thrown away. The idea that a farm is a box which can be assigned a number in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}

\par The impact on the SVS is likely to be slow to be realised.
\par The SVS  is not known for its ability to meet challenges or streamline its systems.
\par As the number of vets involved in farm work decreases it will have to provide more of its own resources to tackle tasks currently done by LVIs. 
\par The more flexible private practice takes up the challenge of getting backlogs in testing don
e and can respond to new challenges for example the licensing brought in during FMD. Private practice can fit the work around other duties. Whereas if it is going to be done by the SVS it will be more expensive to take on vets to do these tasks alone. 

\par The SVS was notoriously unreliable in its work allocation during FMD, the record being sending 5 vets to the same farm on the same day has yet to be beaten!
\par  Though I hope it would be a lot better in normal circumstances, there are still problems with the allocation system that can only be put right by local knowledge.
\par 
\par  In areas where there are few farm animals there may well not be LVIs willing to carry out the routine testing for Notifiable Disease. Who is going to provide veterinary cover for these? Both for clinical caseload and for the LVI work. 
\par 
\par  There will not be vets available to second to DEFRA for the next FMD or exotic disease outbreak. The contingency plan confidently states that resources for 20 TVIs are to be kept at each centre in case of an ou
tbreak of Notifiable Disease, with out addressing where these will come from. There will not be 20 TVI\rquote s available at short notice.  During March 2001 the majority of vets at the Carlisle DECC were LVI\rquote s.

can just be added on as it is a simple export thing so it would take half an hour to do it.\'94 This was last Friday by now it is we have to go for training by SVS. It should only take half an hour to through the forms\'85.\'94
 Why can their yes not be yes, and their no be no???\'94

 to got through meaningless forms, so that we can fill in meaning less forms so that Nestle can get th milk through customs. I am beginning to see why people just smuggle things rather than get involved in all this stupid bureaucracy.

Went on the Factory visit to Nestles today to have a look around so that we know the plant and can giv
e them certification for the milk powder for export. The whole thing is ludicrous as dried milk powder is a sterile product. It has to be or else it goes off very quickly so why we have to certify that it has been pasteurised I don not know. But hey its m
oney.
\par The size and quantity and the huge amount of machinery and very small number of people required to maintain and operate the plant was awesome.
\par We went to the distribution warehouse where there was just row upon row of pallets, 3-7 high full of dried milk or cappuccino drinks. Weird to think mast of the instant cappuccino is made in Dalston.

\par Took the opportunity to go through with DEFRA admin staff some of the queries and
 problems. At the moment we do a lot of stuff for DEFRA telling them who has stock and who does not have stock to ensure their database is relatively up to date. But it is a headache as they are working off computer screens. Hence Mrs F R}{
\fs24\insrsid14645057  }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 of A Farm does not correlate at all with Mr E R}{\fs24\insrsid14645057  }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 
of the same address. The computer is not into relationships. So that they are married and live together and own stock on the same piece of ground does not really get off the ground.  
\par This evening was the final Partners meeting where I handed in my notice.
\par The reasons for handing in my notice are complex, most decisions probably are.
\par There are lots of factors some trivial to the outsider but important to me, others may be important to others and similarly not to me. 
\par Several people have asked is it a reaction to FMD. The last casualty. In some ways it is. For all the horrendous experiences, for all the long hours and difficult ethical and to whom am I responsible dilemmas. It taught me a lot about myself. To see fear 
in the eyes of senior management when challenged, to be able to organise a protest meeting of thirty vets with Jim Scudamore, to do the TV interviews, o see the effect of feeding information to journalists. To be able to break through by fast talking and 
r
elying on my wits. To organise completely new systems and manage projects that had never been done before, to build teams from international backgrounds in the face of opposition from the hierarchy, to be constantly caught on a tight rope between the diff
erent groupings. I learnt that I have huge abilities, and to go back to normality is difficult. 
\par The future of farm animal practice is also very unpredictable. There are a lot of farms who are yet to restock, the cross subsidy of fees by drug sales is going
 to end, and more and more work will be on behalf or paid for by DEFRA. They are at the whims of the politicians and the treasury. They are also not the easiest client to deal with.
\par There is also the problem of being second in command and dealing with the 
frustrations of the partnership. We are not united in the way we work, or where we see the practice going. This means my schemes for diversification, for improving income streams, and managing the bad debt, will either not happen or will become part of my
 workload which is already over stretched.
\par Add in to this cock tail the fact my wife is starting to work, and I have been given a really bad scare by being tackled by a cow. 
\par The question is do I want to do this job for the next 20 years the answer has to be no.
\par So the only answer is to hand in my resignation and start to look for something new.
\par As I have a 6 month notice period ending on an accounting date I have to jump before I have another job sorted out.
\par Even so the decision was very hard and I was really choked up when I left them to discuss the future. I could not go home as the kids would want to know what was going on so I went to J
s. He already knew. I will tell the kids on Friday the practice manager on Monday and work on Tuesday.
\par I have said very little of my thoughts in the diary as I have learnt there are somethings better left unwritten until the time for the information to be public. Whatever issues are to do with confidentiality, if you don\rquote 
t think something can be talked about, then do not write it down, as you never know who is going to read it.
\par }{\fs24\insrsid15092794 A}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  though got her self in to a stew as I rang }{\fs24\insrsid10313242 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  to say I was going to Js, she then said she would come out. She left a bit too hurriedly for }{

at work. I had thought about how I should do it, and what I was to say. It is quite difficult both from an emotional point of view and from the fact that I think that the business in the longer term, will have problems. This has both a direct relevance fo
r
 the lay staff and their jobs. Though there will still be a similar number needed as their workload is likely to remain the same. And also for the vets. Two of whom may or may not be approached to buy into the business. There will also in the longer term 
be a smaller number of vets needed but this will probably be managed by natural wastage.
\par I spoke first to the senior assistants and then lay staff. It was hard as I have been there for as long as many of them 15 years. Which is a long time. I think also the
re is an attitude that the ups and downs seem to be past for them. There was a lot of upheaval over the move from B V up to S park, FMD is over, and things are suppose to be getting back on to an even keel. And I throw a spanner in the works.

Went and read the TB test for the tenant farmer. There was 1 I/R. The reaction of the farmer took me back fairly badly and I was quite shocked at the sheer vehemence of his reaction, fortunately it was mostly at DEFRA . He went out early on to the diseas
e and he therefore got much lower compensation than a lot of the later ones. He had some cattle wintering at his farm for some one else who went out later on with FMD at his home holding. The difference in the valuations for the same type of cattle was ho
rrendous.
\par He also has buildings that he owns on a small parcel of land. The buildings were old and knackered but usable. (A lot of string and gates.) DEFRA pulled them to pieces during FMD and then offered him peanuts o reinstate them, which meant he could 
not get them back into a usable state. So he is not a happy bunny.
\par Spent the afternoon castrating horses which is not my favourite job. If a stirk kicks you, it hurts. If a horse kicks you, it usually means a trip in an ambulance. You are therefore very tense and ready to move in awkward positions.

ugh. Unfortunately his costings are on buying in dairy cows at \'a36-700 per head and just recently they have gone to over a thousand which means he is out by \'a360K, oops. But he said that he thought I was deserting them. In a way I suppose I am.

 was off school today. He was full of cold and just exhausted. He just needed time out really. He goes at everything at 110%.

Footie training at night. Only the hard core turned up, so looks like we will have a good group of 
14-15 which means we will not have to choose and disappoint. Went for a run afterwards as feeling in need of exercise as not much large animal work at the moment means I am sitting around on the computer for a lot of the day which is sad. Must get fit is 
a constant resolution.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 I was at work when I had a phone call from some one who had apparently run over }{\fs24\insrsid11042402 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid3294278  at school. Never an easy phone call to tak
e, espy as she did not know what had happened. Fortunately he was OK.  He had been walking backwards and had stepped into the path of a car which had caught his heel. The damage was slight but it had upset him. 
\par The school exit is appalling and needs sorted as busses, cars and bikes all share the same area as the kids walking. Inevitably kids are jostling and messing around so it is an accident waiting to happen.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 Church in the morning was joint communion and was lead by the Denton Holm house group. 
The church meets up in small groups mid week to pray and study bible, and the Denton Holme grp lead the service, it means you get a refreshingly different type of service with different people taking part and leading. It was good. Followed by a picnic in 
the park which was OK but I just wanted to fall asleep in the sunshine. I am suffering from stopping syndrome. I can keep going on the adrenalin but when I stop, thump, I fall asleep and can not get going.
\par Picked up Liz from church in the evening. Having left youngest two at home as }{\fs24\insrsid14832608 [wife] }{\fs24\insrsid3294278

 with a caesarean which was really nice as that time in the morning is beautiful. It is just a shame that the rest of the day is a bit of a wash out because of it. Went at night to the FA training course which was class room based on a warm sun
ny evening and I was struggling to stay with it. I have also decided that I need to get fit as the practical day is going to be very long for my unfit legs.

The electrician arrived to sort out the electrics in the bathroom, which are still not right. The lights keep fusing and the fan will not work. I had a look at the wiring which is a mess and decided I could not follow it, and after my last experience I de

\par }{\fs24\insrsid3294278 The email from the verse of the day seems to sum up a years worth of diaries
\par When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider:
\par God has made the one as well as the other. 
\par Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.
\par 
\par Ecclesiastes 7:14, New International Version
\par 
\par The future is uncertain, I will leave my job in a few months time for a new start. The pressures of FMD seem to be distant in the warm summer weather and in the quiet workload making me feel rested and relaxed.
\par The challenges both for agriculture, the veterinary practice and for policymakers are still very large. 
\par There is now a threat of bio terrorism to add to the food scares and the threat of exotic disease. 
\par Life carries on, we may not learn from all our mistakes, and government depts are a blunt, slow awkward machine, but the cows will still need to be milked and we will still need food on our table. If in \rquote 68 you 
told some one that we had not had an outbreak of FMD for 35 years, they would have said \'93well done\'94. If you had said 2 men were milking 300 cows on a Cumbrian farm, and getting 7000 litres per cow he would never have believed you.  
\par 
\par There is a time for everything,
\par And a season for every activity under the heaven.
\par 
\par A time to be born and a time to die
\par A time to plant and a time to uproot
\par A time to kill and a time to heal
\par A time to tear down and a time to build
\par A time to weep and a time to laugh
\par A time to mourn and a time to dance
\par A time to scatter stones and a time to gather them
\par A time to embrace and a time to refrain
\par A time to search and a time to give up
\par A time to keep and a time to throw away
\par A time to tear and a time to mend
\par  A time to be silent and a time to speak
\par A time to love and a time to hate
\par A time for war and a time for peace.}{\b\fs24\insrsid3294278
