\par Week 2}{\f0\fs24\insrsid16392171 
\par Monday morning there was a terrible smell from the tip. It really is a nauseating smell. I\rquote 
m not sure if it is the fumes from the vents they put in or they are opening in to old rubbish. Some nights you can see the gas being burnt off and occasionally during the day. There was an article in th
e Herald a few weeks ago about a firm wanting to build a generator there using the gas from the tip to create electricity. They said that the tip could create enough gas for the next 40 years. I think that it is a good idea; the gas may as well be used as
 an energy source as just burned.

The children can now play in the fields again. The first time they went in was when it snowed. They had great fun building snowmen, igloos and doing snow Angels. It\rquote s hard to believe that it\rquote s a year since they had to stop 
going in. We couldn\rquote

\par I saw some lambs for the first time this week on a farm that has F & M. It was good to see. You got so used to seeing empty fields. It was very depressing. It will take a long time before people have much confidence in the future.
\par It looks hopeful that the Environ
ment Agency is going to monitor the disposal sites. It is worrying that the fluid may seep into the water table; the carcasses were buried in cells that had already been used for rubbish, this was removed and the dead animals put in. So the cells would al

\par The word that I frequently seem to use is hope, it seems that is all we can do. Every time you watch the news it seems as if there is no good news anywhere on this earth. So hope is all a lot of people have and for some there is very little of that.

\par The News and Star is full of news about the public meetings that have been held. It seems that a lot of people aren\rquote

o
f people demonstrating against putting thousands of carcasses in landfills near their homes. The nature of the disease is to spread quickly, so measures taken against it have to be done quickly as well. There fore it posses the question will the holes tha

Got a letter from Cumbria Waste Management last week they are holding a meeting in the Village Hall on the 12}{\super\insrsid16392171 th}{\insrsid16392171  April about the Tip. You had to book your place so I\rquote 
ve done that. No doubt there will be a lot of people there.
\par I have been able to watch them tipping rubbish all week. They are on top of a mound that they have made. There could be a whole mountain range there by the time they 
\par 
\par have finished. From what I can gather from the people who have lived here along time the tip would be classed as full when the rubbish reached the ground level. But there is more rubbish to dispose of now than when i
t first opened. Conclusion: ??? They will keep dumping for as long as possible. When we came to live here (6 ys ago) you could see the fells from the downstairs windows but not know (}{\i\insrsid16392171 now}{\insrsid16392171 ).
\par Last week of term this week. It\rquote s only been 4 weeks, so a really long one next time. Wonderful. On Friday L}{\insrsid13655890  }{\insrsid16392171 
(one of the girls I work with in the school kitchen) and I had to judge the decorated egg competition. The children have some really good ideas and put so much effort in to it., it really is hard to decide which one
s are the best. We try to pick the ones that look as if the children have done them by themselves. Some of the Reception and year 1s are far too good for little people to have done. I think they should all have a cr\'e8
me egg for entering. That way everyone wins and we don\rquote t have to make hard decisions.
\par Not a lot seems to have happened this week. Spring is obviously on the way, there are plenty of daffodils and crocuses about and things are getting milder, but }{\insrsid5325477 that, may}{\insrsid16392171  change.
\par The countryside still seems to be quiet to me; there are sheep about but not so many lambs. Dad would usually start lambing about now so that\rquote s maybe why I think it\rquote s quiet when we are usually so busy.
\par There was the first Auction this week for at Carlisle hopefully things will start to get back to normal quickly for all our sakes.
\par I watched a programme called \lquote It\rquote s a }{\insrsid5325477 cow\rquote s}{\insrsid16392171  life\rquote 
 all about a cow called Lulu her travels through the short life of a cow going to be slaughtered for beef. The ending showed her being slaughtered. Shot, throat cut
, gutted, the lot. I bet that gave people watching a few qualms. I certainly did. You know what happens but you don\rquote t want to see it.
\par The special needs Teacher tested }{\insrsid1194332 [son]}{\insrsid16392171  on Friday for dyslexia. The result was positive. So now I have to wait until she contacts me and then we can discuss what to do next. I\rquote 
ll probably have to pay for someone to give him some help. He has one extra help lesson a week now but whether he\rquote ll get anymore I don\rquote t know. What is annoying about it is that the Primary School he was 
at they never picked it up. They have special needs Teacher she should have picked up on it. At one school for years and they don\rquote t pick up on it but at secondary school for a few months and they do. Well I\rquote 
ll just hope things get better for }{\insrsid1194332 [son]}{\insrsid16392171  now we know what the problem is.
\par I had a good clean up for my Granda this week. He\rquote s 91 and still lives on his own. He has care ladies that go and help him get dressed in the morning and undressed at night. They also make his lunch, so that\rquote s one less job for me. 
He does like to tell you all about his younger days and when he worked in the quarry at Flusco. There is a quarry museum at Threlkeld that has the actual shovel that Granda drove. Granda was asked to go and have his photo taken with it but he wouldn
\rquote t be persuaded to go.

\par I bought a Cumberland News last Wednesday the next one had com
e out by the time I read mine. It had an article about the inquiry that is to be held and that Brigadier Birtwhistle is prepared to give evidence He will probably tell them that the Government was far too slow in trying to get it under control. I hope he 
says that because it is a common feeling round here. It says they hope the inquiry will provide \'93closure\'94 for many people devastated by last year\rquote 
s outbreak. It will only do that if it provides straight answers and where it really came from. I think that if
 the Government held their hands up and admitted that they made mistakes people would think better of them. We all know nobody is perfect. It is a novel idea that a politician would admit being wrong!!!
\par There is going to be some Agricultural shows this year but no animal classes because of the regulations that have been imposed, one of them being no livestock on the site for 28 days before and after the event.
\par Dad was talking to a farmer who was wintering some of his in-lamb ewes on another farm. They bought some cattle and now the farmer can\rquote 
t bring his sheep home for 20 days. These ewes are due to lamb, so regulations are still causing problems and they say Foot and Mouth is over!!!
\par It is good to see all
 the reports and pictures in the papers of the sales at the auctions. There is still along way to go on the road to recovery but it is a start. A lot of farmers have had to do a lot of hard thinking on which way direction to take but like most industries 
t
hings have to change but to have to do it because of a devastating disease like F/M makes it an unnatural progression. It is increasingly difficult for farmers to pass their farms on to the next generation. It sounds inane but the feelings that farmers ha
ve for their land and animals are inbreed in them. I have a great love of the land but will probably never have the money and backing to farm. Maybe one day as a hobby but not as a commercial venture.
\par We are still able to see them, working at the tip. I talked to J}{\insrsid12400127  }{\insrsid16392171 
the other day. (she lives next door but one) she says that she can smell the tip early in the mornings and very late at night. She says that it is very like the smell when they were burying the carcasses. This is probably the time they open the pi
pes to burn the gasses off. I suppose most people have their windows shut at those times of day so most of us won\rquote t smell it. But when it is dark you can see the gas being burnt.

\par }{\insrsid16392171 Back to school this week. Over the Easter holidays the school has had the hall painted, it is lilac and very bright terracotta. Took about in your face! Anyone I've talked to doesn\rquote 
t really like it but headmaster does, it his choice. I finally got Granda's kitchen carpet laid this week. He seems pleased that it, so that's what matters. I have to try and get his grass cut soon or it will be lik
e the wilderness again. Like most old people he loves to tell you about things that happened years ago. He was telling me about the sacks that the flour came in, when they were empty they would be boiled to remove the name and used for pillowcases. Jute s
acking was used as mats. Everything had a use after the original one.
\par We are all guilty of condemning the way our country is run and the way the law works but we do live in a stable country compared to others. I can't begin to imagine what it's like to live
 in the West Bank or Israel. The burning question is what makes these people want to be suicide bombers? I can't grasp that concept at all, to believe in something that strongly that you would be willing to give up your life for it. People said they hate 
something but in real terms its dislike of being willing to blow yourself up and killing others in the name of the cause is real hatred for the opposition.
\par There was an open meeting for all the villagers on Friday night (12 April) with Lakeland Waste Management. For the size of the village there wasn\rquote 
t many there. They told us that they had put plans in for a flare to burn off the gases, but it is already in place because the Environment Agency said it had to be one that burned off the gases that also had to
 have a second burner that burnt off the exhaust gases as well. The Environment Agency had given them six months to apply for permission but L W M said they had run out of time to apply so had put it in and then applied after. The might as well have done 
it the right way round because they wouldn\rquote 
t have been refused, on the grounds that it was an environment issue. They have plans in for a generator; as well, some people are worried about noise, but the manager said that  they had put one in at Hespin Wood 
next to his office and was very little noise. 
\par This manager }{\insrsid13701331  }{\insrsid16392171 has only been at Flusco for six months, he came from Hespin Wood and the manager from here went to Hespin Wood. These companies must think that us  the public are not too quick but yes we do know
 why they do this any awkward questions and the answer is always \'93I wasn't here then so I can't comment\'94. Very convenient. They are going to arrange a site visit for us in six months time and we should be sent minutes when the meeting as well. Wh}{

he gave out his phone number at the site so we could ring him right away so he could try to trace where it was coming from, but he won\rquote t be there at five or six o'clock in the mornings or late at night when it seems to be wors
t. He'll probably get more calls than he would like. The smell has been awful very early in mornings this week especially on Monday. It is strange that you can smell it and then 20 yards down the road you can't. Very strange. From what was said the smell 
won\rquote 
t disappear until the site is completely full and every cell is full, permanent membrane and topped off with clay. A cause of great concern is the height of cells. When planning permission was given the residents were led to believe that height was not 
much higher than the original ground level. It was Wimpy that had the tip at the time and of course L W M say that they are still working within the limits of that permission. But a lot of older residents that were here then are not happy at all. In the s
ix years that we've been here the mounds at the tip have grown immensely.

There was an open meeting in the Village Hall on Wednesday night (17th) to discuss whether we should organise something to celebrate the Golden Jubilee. Also Lakeland waste management has said that there is a grant of \'a3
21,000 for the Village because of the disposal site, but it has to be an environmental project or public amenities project. So my idea of everyone having an equal amount taken off their council tax at source was
 no good. I thought that it was fair and everyone would benefit. It probably wasn't possible to do anyway. So a committee was set up for each of the projects. I ended up on the committee to organise something for the Jubilee. It seems that we will have a 
s
ports day and something else. I had tried to avoid both committees as there were a lot of new faces at the meeting and I thought that it would make a change from the same ones organising things. Here is like any other village it is the same people that or
g
anise things and it is always them but don't help that do the complaining, usually saying that there is never anything to do here but when there is they don't attend. The saying is true you can't please everybody all the time. Some around here you can't p
lease at all. Having said that there were a lot of people there that may want to be 
\par involved now. He would be good because there doesn't seem to be that much community spirit at Newbiggin.

There are people there that 
think about living in the countryside is a wonderful idea but when they experience it first hand they find it is not as idyllic as they had anticipated especially in winter when the gritter wagons haven't been round. I once read an article about a family

hat were going to live the dream life in the country, better air, growing your own veg and all that sort of thing, but they found that if he wanted to go anywhere or the children wanted to go to dance classes and them sort of things you have to getting th

 car. The mother said that she would be far more environmental by living in town. So back they went. Granted within Cumbria the landscape and views etc are fantastic but in a lot of areas in winter are very bleak. Like everything else there are two sides 
to it\line 
My Granda up is very pleased with the carpet that I laid for him, so he now thinks that I should put one in his bedroom, but only if I have some carpet, he doesn't want to buy any. He is a firm believer that you don't spend money on household things i
f you can help it. I suppose it was like that when he was growing up. He has seen a great many changes in his life (he's 91). He says that a lot of things needed to change but not everything has changed for the better. He has led a hard life farmwork and 
h
e spent about 45 years working in Flusco quarry. When he first went there everything was done by hand and there were about 200 men working there. Nobody could do that today the wages bill alone would be horrendous and no insurance company would give you a
n accident policy. In a lot of aspects it is better that people don't have to work as hard (physically) as that any more.\line

 they have been buried at Flusco. So that is something I will have to bring up for the next meeting with L W M. It was just supposed to be culled stock but was buried there. I don't suppose that they will ever tell me if there is diseased stock there.}{

I've just read a good novel called Trust Me. It was about children shipped from orphanages over here to orphanages in Australia in the 1950s supposedly for a better life. The one I'm starting now is about what i

The inquiry has started this week at Kendal. It will probably take a long time before they produce their findings and hopefully some good will come out of it.\line 
The trial of the farmer at Heddon-on-the-wall is also taking place. I haven't heard much apart from there was a large amount of cutlery found in among the swill, so that alone proves it had never been treated, as it should.\line I talked to P}{

It was the Spring Fair at school on Friday night. I was on teas and coffees as usual, but there didn't seem to be as many people there as in past years. The school usually raises about \'a32,000 plus. It is the main fundraiser for the school.\line 
There is a great deal of talk about grants for regeneration schemes but there doesn't appear to be much happening. Cumbria County Council have freed up \'a3500,000 for use now. 
Because of the strict criteria of North West Development Agency there is a delay in releasing the money for regeneration projects. It doesn't say what the criteria is for receiving a grant off this scheme but no doubt there won't be many projects that wil
l fill them. Maybe I'm cynical but these things look good on paper but aren't so easy in practice. A really good practical idea doesn't often fill the criteria or of these grant givers. Let's hope I'm wrong.\line 
Planning permission has been granted parole landf
ill gas electricity generation compound at Flusco for Summerleaze regeneration. I think that it is a good idea to use the gas in this way. But there is some around here that wouldn't agree with me. The Tip is there, there's nothing that can be done about 
t
hat so let's use everything possible to make it more environmentally friendly. They started her door-to-door collection of newspaper and cardboard last year. About time I thought but on the days they collect there isn't that many people put it out. I have
 recycled everything I can for a long time. It makes it easier when they come to pick it up though. There are now bins in B&Q car-park for plastic bottles hooray. I think it is a charity that has placed them there.\line 
I once saw a programme about a Scandinavian country (can't remember which one) that composts all the rubbish that will rot down in big warehouses. An idea which wants looking into, I think. Lots of things are better than burying it in the ground.

\par }{\b\ul\insrsid16392171 WEEK 12}{\insrsid16392171 \line Reading the reports in last week's Hera
ld it seems as if the three kilometre cull was a bad decision from the start.. It looks as if movement of all stock right at the start and blood-testing would have been a better solution. Some people think it should have been cattle culled and not sheep.
\line The inquiry will no doubt bring to light every mistake and bad decision that was taken. But whether it comes up with a better game plan if it happens again and we will have to wait and see.\line 
There are those that still think it was deliberately started to red
uce the numbers of sheep but it would have been far easier to stop the subsidy altogether. There wouldn't have been the heartache, trauma and disruption that there was. It always seemed to me to be a far-fetched idea but having said that politicians can c
ome up with some pretty daft ideas.\line 
There is going to be a lot of confusion over the licences but you have to  have for doing things like shearing, some have the right ones now while some will have to apply. So many will not know what they're doing. Many of
 these restrictions and licenses will probably be here to stay. More red tape and "jobs for the boys'" as one farmer described it. . One article says the farmers themselves should pay for compulsory slaughter if there is another outbreak. The cost of prod
u
cing meat is going to be more than what it is sold for. Then we would have to rely on imports. Which is not a good idea. You will not know if it has been produced to the same regulations as British farmers have to abide by. In France that they still rear 
veal in crates, which is banned in this country. I once watched some programme but said Britain was the biggest importers of veal in the EU, so maybe most of the population don't care how and where their meat is produced.\line 
It said on the radio that marts would be having live animal sales again but I other things I've heard say that it  won't be happening, confusion still reigns. What will happen long term is anyone's guess.\line 
Brigadier Birtwhistle seems to have spoken his mind at the inquiry. He hadn't much goo
d to say about many people. We went for a load of "organic manure" at a farm down the road (it's something we couldn't do last year) and he wanted to restock with ewes but hadn't because the asking price was \'a3
100 for a broken mouthed ewes. It was ridiculous some of the prices that were asked but most haven't restocked to their former numbers anyway. So demand wouldn't be as high as anticipated.\line L}{\insrsid1194871  }{\insrsid16392171 
(that I work with) and her husband went back to hospital for the results for his bone scan. It was clear but the
 surgeons say that there is only a five per cent chance of an operation being successful so they won't operate. They are going to try some sort of immune therapy. It boosts the white blood cells. But when he was first diagnosed they said that this therapy
 was not a cure, now they say it is. The success rate is slightly higher than an operation. So it doesn't look too good, but we will keep our fingers crossed that it is successful \line 
\par \line }{\b\ul\insrsid16392171 Week 13}{\insrsid16392171 \line It said on the radio that some of the Rural Recovery money is goin

It's the same with schools all these different tables to show who is doing the best. They are all a waste of time. I don't think they show a true reading at how well a school is doing. Children that the teachers don't think will perfo
rm well aren't entered into the Test because that pulls the average down. The children at Stainton are coached and had mock tests the weeks before the event.\line 
Reading the Herald (18th May I'm always a week behind with it) there are articles on what has been
 said at the inquiries. There isn't much in them that people living here don't already know, but let's hope that the inquiry team take notice and come up with a practical plan if it ever happens again.\line 
For a long time before the F and M outbreak farmers we
re classed as a minority, their business didn't generate much income for the economy then all of a sudden when it was in trouble every other sort of business was losing money because of the trouble farming was in. Granted a vast amount of trade was lost l
ast year but farmers were the only ones they had their assets taken away. Now people are complaining that farmers are better off than they are. It doesn't matter what farmers do they\rquote 
re damned if they do and damned if they don't. All money in the world don'
t compensate for the emotional horrors that people lived through on farms that had dead stock lying for days and days before they were disposed of. I can't really comprehend what it was like living in constant fear of getting the disease because Dad's she

I've seen a newspaper every da

stroyed by death, destruction and war. I'm not averse to good news but they never seems to be much of that. I suppose I'm in the minority with what I regard as news. What is in them now is what sells them.\line }{\insrsid1194871 [son]}{\insrsid16392171

I work with at the school and if I'm honest most of the children as well, but the hours are so low. The time I worked depended on the amount of dinners we cooked, so less dinners less time. I've been there three and half years so it's a bit nerve-racking

\insrsid14302098  }{\insrsid16392171 who farms nea
r there. The last 18 months have been extremely miserable for him he was wiped out with F and M then in November his wife died of cancer. He also lost his father. He has restocked with sucklers and some sheep but the price went too high for the sheep he w
a
nted so he hasn't bought as many as he wanted to. There is a forest next door to his fields, where there is a nice walk through it. Lots of people use it. But as often happens people just let their dogs off and more than one attacked his sheep, some died 
a
nd some were seriously injured. The vet spent all one morning stitching and patching them up. Granted he can't be a hundred percent sure that's where the dogs came from but it is a distinct possibility. He has been shearing this last week and found more w
ith scars on them under their fleeces. Some haven't recovered from the ordeal yet and it happened quite a while ago. One was bitten down to the jawbone and it still hasn't healed properly.\line 
Some people have no idea at all what damage their dogs can do and so
me don't even care. Dogs are supposed to be kept under proper control and that should mean on a lead especially in the lambing season. The attitude now seems to be that the countryside is a play area or not somewhere people are working to make a living. O
K they often go hand in hand but some people seem to believe they can go and do what they want with no respect anyone else.
\par On to something completely different. My knew job is going alright. I'm enjoying it. It is similar to what I grew up doing. Dad had a

\line As 
if there hasn't been enough trouble in the family lately, my cousin, who is a lorry driver, was coming down from Stranraer when a man walked right out in front him. He timed it so that he hadn't any chance to miss him. He wasn't killed outright but died o
n the way to hospital. The police found a suicide note in the man's car, so it was intentional. Now }{\f0\fs24\insrsid4342759 [cousin]}{\f0\fs24\insrsid16392171 
 has to live with the fact that he killed someone even though it was not his fault. I know that people are not in their right mind when they commit s
uicide but they needn't involve anyone else. I suppose he wanted to end his life but couldn't bring himself to harm himself so thought someone else could kill him instead. But we will never really know the answer to that.\line 
Thinking about what I've just writ
ten, I have come to the conclusion that I'm rather more it? Strange? I'm not sure how to describe it but I would find it very interesting to find out the answers of what goes through people's minds that do things like that.\line 
You watch programmes and read things about horrendous crimes that people commit 
\par and they may have done them over a long period of time and when they are caught they cannot see what a wrong they have done. They defend what they did. It is frightening to think that someone can see no harm
 in what they have done. It is intriguing how the human mind works even in everyday life. God am I weird for what?\line Anyway back from that tangent my sciatica is getting a little better hopefully it will be gone soon. All the walking at work helps.

p
osed to go. He may be frail in body but certainly not in mind. He has also bought a chair that can rise up to help you get out and the back goes down so you can sleep in it. He seems to spend quite a few nights in the chair because he can't get comfortabl

a lot of people visiting will be stimulating for him.\line 
Granda got his bed in hospital on Monday. He wasn't too happy about going but they will get his pills sorted out and build him up. That is what happened last time. I went to see him on Thursday he looked
 very small and frail lying on the bed. He said that he had fallen that morning. It seems to be happening more and more. J had been in to see him the night before and he said that Granda was very wobbly when he saw him. The thing that is worrying Granda i
s
 his cat; he thinks that it will pine and may be run away. I told him that it was eating everything I give it and we were making friends. It let me stroke it, so it must be feeling lonely. He keeps telling me that if anything happens to him I have to have
 the cat put down he doesn't want anyone else have it. I don't think it would live with anyone else, it's a one-man cat and it's quite an old cat.\line 
Dad has got some of his hay made and we have got it in the barn. There is one field left to do but it won't be ready to bale for another day, as long as the weather holds.\line 
Last year was everyone got good hay and made twice as much just to do something with the grass and this year it has been a fight to get it. The lady that has moved into the house next door to Gr

 is rank.\line 
It's not very good news about Penrith mart closing. It will mean a trip to Carlisle or Cockermouth's. So if you only have a few sheep or a couple of calves to sell it won't be worthwhile going. Maybe the farmers that want to take that and other ma

I watched a programme called Milk Wars the other week, I hadn't seen it when it was first on, I saw the second one where they had joined up w

t\rquote 
s turnover. It's totally unbelievable that they can do something like that. It doesn't sound like free-trading to me. If the supermarket is willing to buy British milk or any other product and pay a fair price for it then that is what should happen. There
 is no need to buy from abroad especially milk. On the bottle it says fresh milk but how fresh is it if it has come from abroad? I noticed in Safeway last week that a bottle had Union Jack on it but he didn't say British or Scottish (which is what usually
 
says) milk, so as far as I know that sign means that it has only been packed in Britain. All the labelling that is on food now it can still be very misleading and you don't know where it has come from. I also found out about Nestle importing milk so I dec
ided that I would stop buying their products where possible. It is surprising just what they do make and you don't know what they

Instead of culling to contain the disease maybe vaccination would be the better options. All the facts should be looked at now so the decision could be made now and not at the height of the crisis. It is the type of decision that can be made beforehand.

It's just something else to add to the list
 of Labour's incompetence. The firemen going on strike could be the last nail in Tony Blair's coffins. Labour has wasted so much money there is nothing left for the important things like public services and education etc. They have spent and spent but hav
e
n't bought any money back in. Not many people mind paying a little more tax as long as the money is spent wisely. It even seems that when Labour came to power there was surplus of money. If so then the next government is going to have an uphill struggle a

A lot of the recommendations but had been put forward in the reports are what people were saying at the time of the epidemic. The government? The authorities? Wouldn't take any notice then so maybe they will now.\line It also seems that a lot of farmers
 are falling foul of the rules and regulations that are still in force or have been brought in since the epidemic without realising they are doing so. There is so much "bumf" that arrives it's hard to know what's what.\line 
Sitting here thinking about everythin
g that happened last year and the consequential fall out from it all is quite depressing and it makes you wonder why anyone would carry on farming. On the surface it looks like farmers have plenty of money when you see the price they are paying for stock 
and equipment they are buying, but if they don't roll compensation back into the farm the taxman will take it. So they spend it. Mind you I'm hearing some rather large prices being paid for tips \'a3

The question of vaccinating instead of c

 said that we shouldn't be able to export meat if it had been vaccinated but some countries weren't taking it anyway. All auctions should be looked into. All options should be looked at and hopefully a better contingency plan will be put in place. The las

4 million. No one would be interviewed for fear of legal action, DEFRA declined to be interviewed as well. But it does make you think when one haulage firm was paid \'a3

 has to be protected and have value for money, they are saying. The government won't be saying that when they take us to war. They won't listen to the public (yet again) when they are told that we don't want to go to war. George W Bush is more of a threat

I have to get the doctor out to Granda on Sunday. He phoned me to say he didn't feel too good. He was verging on the edge of panic when I got there. He was so wound up, he didn't know whether to stand up, sit d

of a buzzing headache, double vision and his balance wasn't very good. So when I described the symptoms to the doctor on the phone he said it could be the onset of a stroke or a swollen blood vessel. If it was then he would have to go to hospital, not tha

 wouldn't believe me. Anyway the doctor said that he would get in touch with Granda's own doctor and that we should do the same so that Dr Buckle would know that home visit was warranted. The Cuedoc thought that Granda could be heading towards pneumonia.
 Not something you want to hear at the best of times let alone half past five in the morning when your defences are low. Anyway I had to ring Aunty V, Granda couldn't be left on his own and I had to see to }{\insrsid1194332 [son]}{\insrsid16392171  and }{
\insrsid12400127 [other son]}{\insrsid16392171 . I didn't like ringing her a

zzy and if he had fallen there was no way V}{\insrsid2636464  }{\insrsid16392171 
could lift him. When the doctor did turn up he gave Granda some more antibiotics and took some blood samples. He'd already checked to see if there was a bed at Penrith hospital and there wasn't so we just have to wait for one.\line 
Granda seems to get in a bit of a panic, which is totally understandable when he's there on his own and not feeling well. He is a lot happier when someone is there. Which you can understand as well.\line Another call at 6 o'clock on Thursday morni
ng, I didn't get the doctor out this time, as there was nothing they could do. I gave him some painkillers and turned all the heating off, it was like a furnace when I went in, the fire was on in the living room and a heater was going full blast in the be
d
room. It probably contributed to the headache. I'd only been there 10 minutes when he said he was feeling a lot better so I think that my theory is correct that part of his trouble  feeling very unsafe. His doctor had told me to ring him on Thursday anywa

\line Dad and I it went to see him yesterday (Saturday) and he looked much better. He said he felt better but even if he won't admit it he's bound to feel safer too with having help there 24 hours a day.
\par Uncle D}{\insrsid14307899  }{\insrsid16392171 was there when we were there. And he said that the time was coming when Granda couldn't stay on his own. I wanted to ask what planet D}{\insrsid7606145  }{\insrsid16392171 
has been living on? Granda shouldn't have been on his own for a long time now. But D}{\insrsid7606145  }{\insrsid16392171 only comes on a Sunday to do the week's supply of pills unless otherwise summoned and V}{\insrsid1076691  }{\insrsid16392171 
only comes once a week if that, more often than not it is once a fortnight. Dad doesn't go very often but will go if I need help, }{\insrsid2100478 D}{\insrsid16392171 ad and Granda  don't get on very well that's probably why.\line When V}{
\insrsid2100478  }{\insrsid16392171 and I were there a Monday I tried to talk to her about Granda but she said that she knows he shouldn't be on his own but the decision is Granda's, I think D}{\insrsid2100478  }{\insrsid16392171 thinks the same. V}{
\insrsid2100478  }{\insrsid16392171 was more concerned about making a pair of curtains for a bedroom that's not used. I really think she hasn't any idea what it takes to keep him there. It's a case off if somebody else w
ill do it then she's happy. Maybe I'm too hard on them but they don't have to plan their days around him. This last fortnight I've been down there at least twice a day. I think Violet expected me to stay with him on Friday but I said that I was going to w

gs plus pants department things, so I thought she could do that job.\line 
The time is here for someone to say enough is enough but no one will as Granda is so strong-willed and determined to stay at home. So let's guess who is going have to put their hands up and say no more. Well I suppose we will have to wait and see.\line

It said that on the news that it is going to be equal to allow someone to use your tractor if it has more than 20 litres of red diesel in a because you are then classed as a seller of diese

w
on't be satisfied. The British are the only ones that have to abide by all these rules and regulations that are thought up by Brussels. If our fishing quotas are being cut to preserve the cod stocks then why is nobody else's? Britain is one that puts the

t

a
 better expression) a bollocks of that by following Bush. Okay Saddam wants removing from power and his son as well but is the war  the way to do it? They go on about the weapons of mass destruction but chemical weapons are not as efficient as they are ma
d
e out to be yes they are dangerous and lethal but they can't cover as vast an area in one go as some people are saying. The threat is a great one but before the rest of the countries admitted to their stockpiles would Iraq be any worse? And who supplied a
 
vast amount of their weapons when they were fighting Iran? Us that's who. If Saddam was as great a threat as Blair and Bush say then why is the UN not in full agreement? Why all the debate? The only reason why they want to go to war is oil full stop. they
 
wouldn't be so desperate to start this war if the only reason was the weapons. The US wants control of the oil it's as pure and simple as that. Are they think that the world starts and ends with themselves. Look at one of the overriding emotions to Septem

It is starting to get busy at work for Mother's Day. This weekend and the start of next is the time to be busy, nearer to Mothers Day the florists want cut flowers so if the pot plants are not sold by about Wednesday then it is unlikely that they will be

she could see nothing at all. It seems to have grown so quickly in the last two/three years. But there is still no sign of another meeting with Cumbria Waste Management. Isn't that a surprise?\line 
I helped Dad to get ready for the sheep lambing, all the ones th
at will lamb first need to be brought closer to home and then the 1st April is D-Day. It could be a hard time, as these sheep have never lambed before. They will probably run away when  they see the lamb as often happens. It is easier when there are older
 sheep there to lead the way although the older ones would sometimes pinch another\rquote 
s lamb before they'd had their own. It even took a while for these sheep to learn to feed from a trough because there was no example to follow. It will be strange lambing bec
ause we haven't done it for three years as Dad's sheep went in the cull just a few days before they were due to lamb. I was a big coward, I didn't go to help put them in the lorry that took them away. Dad just thought of them riding around the countryside
 not going to be slaughtered. He probably thinks that they still are. For all I know they could be buried across the field from me. I can still see the animals being tipped out of those lorries into that gigantic hole.\line 
When it first started some people went
 around to see if they could see the heaps of carcasses and pyres. I could never understand that. I would go out of my way to miss these things. I only saw one lot of carcasses being loaded into the back of a tipper. The dual carriageway was partially cor

kes sense to do these jobs when you already have them in a pen, it saves a lot of hassle later on because sheep with lambs are not the easiest things to move and pen. The sheep are always looking for their lambs and the lambs  run away, hide behind gates 
a
nd generally go in the opposite direction to you and when you finally get them penned the noise is horrendous. It's all part of the fun and games of sheep farming. The thing that both sheep and lambs love to do is die for no apparent reason, they really e
xcel at that. A good strong lamb lying dead, it's achieved a life ambition!! It was a glorious sight walking  in and seeing lambs after not having any for three years. It was a good feeling and it now feels like a proper spring.\line 
I never thought I'd miss the sheep as much as I did but it works the other way as well. Things seem more complete and better now there are lambs, normal I suppose, life feels more normal. The cycle is back in place as it should be.\line 
Doing these diaries has made me think a more in-dept
h about my reasons for many of my opinions. I now try to look at things more objectively and not to jump to conclusions as quickly as I did. But there are some things no matter what anyone said I wouldn't change my opinion. Listening to some members of my
 
family I wonder if my way of thinking is not in tune with the rest of society. Things that are really important to them are of little import to me. Maybe I just don't want to run with the crowd. Maybe I should be like an advert I've seen and stand there a

But I've got to admit that all this keeping up the neighbours and doing things because everyone else does it is not something I do. One instance t

be done is to help him as much as possible. He complains that he doesn't sleep very well but he spends most of his time napping! His heart is still strong but the rest of his body is wearing out. It's not a thing to look forward to is old age.

\par }{\insrsid16392171 Dad\rquote s lambing is slow but steady. There have been quite a few big single lambs that have nearly died, the sheep seem to get the head out and then give up, so you have to act quickly to get the sheep lambed. The poor lamb\rquote 
s head swells really fast, so they loo
ked deformed but it doesn't take long for it to reduce back to normal. Things aren't going too badly we've lost a few lambs but no ewes (Oops I shouldn't have said that). There have been a few adoptions and they seem to be going alright, fingers crossed.
\line A
 farmer from up the road came to see if dad had a pet lamb because he hadn't one. He said that they were very scarce. It's because everyone around here are lambing hoggs or shearlings and they normally only have a single or twins and being young  fit anim
als they can cope with that.
\par So with working and going to Dads and Granda's I have been rather busy!! Things should slow down soon I hope. Then I'll be able to get my jobs done. In my dreams! Trying to get a builder is like looking for a flying pig.

\par }{\insrsid16392171 The lambing isn't going too badly, there is still 17 left but 10 of those aren't due until this Tuesday but they could start any time and it will probably go on for a
 long time as one was tipped at Christmas. It is just as well it has been slow because dad couldn\rquote 
t have coped if they have lambed faster. He is in so much pain from his hip. The waiting list is a year for a new one or so that means he has to survive until
 September but there is nothing to say the wait won't be longer, which it probably will be. He shouldn't have lambed really but he thought he'd give it a go but there has been times 
\par especially in the middle of the night when he was going to sell them the next day. I'm doing all I can but I can't be there 24 hours a day. Never mind we will get through it.\line 
I've been waiting months for the builder to come and do the fireplaces so I thought I'd waited long enough, so I asked another one to come and give me a q
uote. So what happened, two days later the original builder turns up and said that if I order the multi-fuel fire he would come and do it. So I had to tell the second one that I didn't need him. He seemed to be all right about it mind I don't know what he
 was thinking. We thought it would be easy to pick a multi-fuel but there is so many different combinations of heat to space and boilers you need the right balance. All the ones I liked so far up to big so the choice is getting narrowed down quite a lot.

\par My
 sister came up on Tuesday for a few days. It is really good to see her. Dad likes having her there and he is most appreciative that she tidied up his garden. It's a good job that she likes gardening. And she even helped him lamb and sheep, well she held 
its head which is a major achievement for }{\insrsid14114973 [her]}{\insrsid16392171 . She never had to help with the sheep but she never wanted to anyway. She was really pleased with what she had done so good for her.

\par }{\insrsid16392171 Lambing has come to a 
halt. There has only been one lamb in four days so it could take quite a while before we are finished. We haven't had any real disasters except for a lamb with meningitis. Dad took it to the vets and when he found out what was wrong with it he got them to
 
put it down. There was no need to let it suffer. Dad doesn't like anything to suffer especially needlessly. Poor Granda isn't too good he says that he feels totally worn out and he said that when he goes the cat has to be put down because it will be miser
a
ble without him. He's probably right although it seems to have taken to the woman next door it even let her give it a worm tablet. If I'd tried it would have been not just a battle but full-scale war!! He is having a struggle to stay at home but he is det
ermined to stay on his own. He talks more and more about dying if he just went in his sleep one night he would be pleased. It must be awful to feel that you're just sat waiting for the end. You can only feel sorry for him.

 sat and talked and who did the looking and printing of information? That's right me. I must be a soft touch if I\rquote ve started doing other people's homework.\line 
I ordered the fire after much debate and head-scratching and pulling out of hair. I ordered it from a company in Lancashire, he is a farmer that has diversified (quite a while ago) in selling stoves etc so I got to know that they had "a good do" s
elling their shearlings last year but it had cost a lot to buy the hoggs to replace them. Here I am spending money and still end up talking farming. His delivery charge is rather unique, a cup of tea!  that I like. So there will be plenty disruption when 
i
t turns up. I've spent days chipping paint off bricks around the back door to give it a rustic look. It wasn't my idea but I've got the job of doing it. They were shot blasted but there is lots of little bits to chip off. I don't think I'll do it again a

\par When I went to work on Monday the lad that started just after Christmas said he was leaving at the end of the week, he's going to drive milk tankers. More money being the reason I think. So that's me back on Sunday 
mornings a bit of overtime anyway. Bank holidays are just a normal working day although you are paid time and a half. George's customers want their orders on Tuesday as normal so we work. 
\par Not many lambs this week but there isn't many left to lamb. I said to dad that it was lovely seeing lambs about the place again, he went quiet and then said " Aye, it is all right." understatement or what? Man of few words is my dad.\line 
I've been chipping more paint off bricks it is taking ages but it is a step in the right 
direction. My five-year plan rapidly turned into a 10 year one and if it carries on at this speed it will end up a 20 year plan!! Well the fire is ordered and the builder has said he will come so fingers crossed things will happen soon. I don't think I ca

\par It was also Mary's funeral in the afternoon at the crematorium. I don't like going to the crematorium it always feels a bit like a production line. A

 Castle Sowerby he didn't want to be cremated. Anyway funerals won't be a mystery to them or something to beef feared.\line I got a phone call at 4:15am on Thursday from Eldercare. Granda had pressed his 
\par button. He was in a state he had a raging headache, was 
wet and needed a wee. I will not tell the details it doesn't take much imagination to know what I had to do. Poor bloke it must be quite degrading for him to have to have help in this way and it being your granddaughter that helps you can't be pleasant. A
n
yway I finally got the doctor out. It is a bit of a performance if you ring to Cue Doc and someone takes all the details and symptoms and then they got the nurse to ring so you have to repeat all the symptoms and then the doctor rang so I went through it 
a

o
uld hear. He settled down when the doctor came. He checked him over and couldn't find anything specific or what was causing a headache so he gave him some more painkillers. Reassurance that there was nothing seriously wrong was a big factor in making gran
der feel a lot better. It must be really scary when you don't feel well and you on your own. V}{\insrsid12127821  }{\insrsid16392171 
came out on Saturday and found him very confused so she had got the doctor out and she wanted to do some blood tests so he's now in Carlisle Infirmary. So we will
 just have to wait and see what happens but there is no doubt that he needs more care than he has now. We all agree on that but what he will have to say is a different story. 
\par Dad went to see the specialist about his ankle but he doesn't want to give anoth
er pain-killing injection because hopefully within the next six months dad will have his hip replacement and they could be a reaction with the injection. So dad will have to wait until after the op to see what can be done with his ankle but it may not be 
a
s painful when he can walk properly again. Dad seems to lurch from one crisis to another these days, he seems to get one thing sorted out and something else drops to bits. Nearly finished lambing only five to go but some of them may not be in lamb. A lot 
of the older lambs have bad feet from this wet weather so we\rquote ve ran them through the foot rot bath and the ewes as well. It has been a busy week and have been to work.\line }{\insrsid6451730 [husband]}{\insrsid16392171

Saturday he seemed a little better but was still rambling a bit, he seemed  to think that he had been there for a long time. All he is bothered about is his "mate" namely the cat. Mind it must be getting lonely because it let me stroke it. It didn't purr

hree to four week delivery on them so hopefully (there's that word again) will be ready for it then. I can see in my mind's eye what it will look like when it is all finished, it just seems to take so long to get it all organised and get someone to do it.

One of Dads relations has been doing the family tree and wanted some information. So dad too
k a book have about Patterdale. There is a chapter in on the Mounseys when we were known as "the kings of Patterdale". it was sheep scab that finally finished us off. As at the time there was no cure or vaccination for it. Getting sheep scab then was like
 
getting foot and mouth now. I ended up going with the information I had. It was interesting to see the family tree; they have got back to seventeenth-century. Some of the stories that I know about are very interesting. One member was a bank manager and em
igrated to Canada with money that didn't belong to him!!! I 
\par know that on my great Grandma\rquote s side of the family there were two mines. over the west of the county.  family histories can turn out quite interesting. Maybe that should be my next project. 
\par Granda is still in hospital I don't know how long he will be there but there isn't much they can do for him. It\rquote

That would be a great improvement if they had to do that.
\par I went to see Granda, he is getting more frail and weak every time I see him. Some days he doesn\rquote t feel well at all. There is to be a meeting with the nurse on the 17}{\super\insrsid16392171 th}{\insrsid16392171 . Auntie V}{\insrsid7091229  }{

 without asking me if I will do it. Not being a very close family doesn\rquote t help either.
\par It was the village sports on Saturday everyone seemed to have a good time. The BBQ
 went down well. I think most of the children spent their winnings on sweets. I had the job of writing the winners down and giving the prize money out. There isn't many older children in the village now so we had to have some very short races for the litt

\par We have been really busy at work, we have been packing on days that we normally don\rquote

 on Wednesday night it was time to sit and think again. Feelings may not be as raw or running as close to the surface as they once were but the same feelings are still the same. People still feel let down by the government and don't trust them. It is time
 
to reflect and learn from the mistakes that were made. It still feels as if no one is listening to those that were working on the ground at the time of the epidemic. To meet it seems logical to have a total lockdown on animal movement as soon as a case ha
s
 been suspected or at the very least confirmed. Culling on suspicion seems to be sensible as well. Watching and waiting would be better than a "voluntary" cull of the surrounding area. An action plan needs to be put in place for if it ever happens again. 
T
he Government needs to see how other countries deal with it and use the reports that have been done here, as well as listening to the people that worked through this epidemic and pick out the options that would work in this country. Above all common sense
 is needed in working out an action plan. Every option must be looked at.\line 
Other things that should be looked at are how it spread and whether disinfectant is effective in stopping it. Would it have spread as fast if the animals were still slaughtered locall

 is counting down the days until the summer holidays; if he had the choice he would spend his time at Dad\rquote s rather than going to school. The themes that run through all these diaries are the thoughts and feelings of most people at th
e time and to a lesser degree now. Although to people that have nothing to do with farming or jobs that relate to farming it will be just a distant memory but having said that it is surprising how many people use it to date things. "it happened before or 
j
ust after the foot-and-mouth". I started conversations at work about it and other places. People still talk about it with a lot of anger and resentment towards the Government and the horror of seeing piles of carcasses and pyres also with great feeling to
wards the people that it directly affected. It doesn't take much to get a discussion going about F and M, so maybe people aren't talking about it as much but it is still there under the surface.\line 
The way people "Battened down the hatches" and dealt with it t
he best way they could is what farmers are noted for. Solid, independent, tough, strong  and a wee bit tatty around the edges on the way most people see farmers, what is unseen is the vulnerability and the way their livelihoods are threatened by drops in 
p
rices, food fads and supermarkets importing cheaper meat and milk. The rules and regulations that are constantly changing. The British have to abide by the EU rules but most other countries don't and they won't buy our meat on the most pathetic excuses. B
u
t if we don't follow the rules the British public lose confidence in British products. The old saying "damned if you do and damned if you don't" seems to be very appropriate for farmers. The woman at the meeting that ran an AI business said that it was lo
v
ely seeing all the buttercups etc in the fields but she didn't seem to make the connection that buttercups mean sour ground. The ground isn't been managed as it was because there isn't the stock, so that's why her business isn't what it was. It is a logic
a
l connection to me. Maybe because farmers don't appear to be open and aren't as vocal as their European counterparts they tend to be viewed as secretive which isn't the case, they get on with what life throws at them and try to make a living. The trust th
ing works both ways no one trusts the government but because farmers are quiet they are perceived as untrustworthy as well. So it might help the farmers if they were a little more vocal and open.\line

 isn't many on a lot of ground they stay healthier. Maggots are a thing to watch out for at this time of year, nasty, horrible things that they are.\line Dad\rquote

\par rid of his excess hay because a farmer from Keswick bought a lot of it last year. Dad was telling me about one farmer that has an acre of round bales stacked up. And another that is burning a few at a time because no one needs them. It must 
be soul-destroying having to do things like that. It is going to take years before things are truly balanced again. Things will never be the same in good and bad ways but the balance is going to take some rectifying.\line 
If it keeps fine this next week (well T
uesday when I'm off work) we will be mowing rubbish. That's a job I've always liked doing, just wandering around the field with my sickle (Dad went let me use the scythe obviously thinks I'm dangerous enough with the sickle!!) chopping down thistles and n
ettles. I find it a very relaxing job and when you're on the highest part of Dad\rquote s land you can see more fells than I can name and you can see up two valleys.  it is grand. But whether I'll be able to do it in years to come is another matter.\line 
Granda is supposed to be coming home on Tuesday. He won\rquote 
t have any more help in so how he's going to manage I don't know, anything anyone suggests to help make life easier for him is never any good. He's been contrary all his life so I don't suppose he'll change now. Bu

As far as the tip goes there has never been another meeting or any contact. I h
ope that  there is nothing leaking from it but we will never know if there is. There is often a strong smell of methane but she can't be sure if it is the tip or the pig farm up the road.\line 
Reading through the electronic tags they seem to have covered every  aspect of people's feelings, what happened and how things have changed.\line 
Stoical, resilient and self-reliant are words that really sum up people round here, but it could also work against them as well because if the farmers don't open up a bit the governme
nt may not think that they are to be trusted. But then the government can't be trusted either so you have a bit of the stalemate. I would rather trust a farmer than the Government any day. Better hadn't start about Tony Blair again or I'll be here all day
!! I've read all the inquiry reports and a lot of it made sense, let's hope that they are taken notice of, and this one of course!\line 
Reading through the first of the diaries that I wrote they did have a tendency to be bit black! But there was always a little 
hope and if you can keep your sense of humour it helps to get you through. There is hope for the future and hopefully (there's that word again) some of the more dafter rules will be done away with. Like the lady having to wear gloves while she judged the 
a
nimals and then anyone could walk up to the animals and touch them. Faith Hope and Charity that is what is needed for the future. Not that I feel very charitable towards the government or have much faith that there will come up with a sensible plan of act
ion but I can always hope!!\line I hope that at least some of my ramblings had been of use to you all and thank you for inviting me to help you. Fare well.
