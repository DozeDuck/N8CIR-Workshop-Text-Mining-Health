Week beginning 11th March 02. Good hard-working week, nothing out of the ordinary, no thoughts on FMD until Sunday 17th March, when playing darts competitio
n at Caldbeck bowling club. A very lively debate on FMD issue, learned a lot. Mixed bunch of farmers, some lost stock, but made money and happy they got FMD. Some got FMD made money, but wish they did not have to go through two months trauma. One small fa
r
mer ie five cows and a few sheep did not get FMD but wished he had, the trauma for him was not getting FMD, wish he had, going out of business now. Summed up winners and losers in farming. Also tourist trade winners and losers, i e some guest houses put u
p FMD men, made good money - some empty. Shops in places like Keswick - Windermere Boom time due to fact visitors could only walk around shops not fells. Winners and losers!\line 
Farm leader said phone never stopped during crisis mainly because farmers needed guidance. Summing up farmers are well organised ie by NFU. Visitor and travel industry needs to organise itself to get a better say.\line

\par During wee

 shopping with wife and son. In the morning went to rubbish tip behind house to dispose of household rubbish (missed bin-men) amazed at the clean tidy }{\fs24\ul\insrsid14616386 tip }{\fs24\insrsid14616386 also at the 
amount of precautions to be seen in extracting foul water and smells. In the evening went to Clickham Inn for a game of pool and a couple of pints with little boy. He beat me at pool for the first time, fair and square, (very good). Conversation 
in pub at one stage crept in about FMD, amazing how this subject won\rquote t go away.
\par Tuesday very busy day at work, started to teach a former pupil of 11 years ago into being an Advanced (?) driving instructor, finished very late. During day spoke with builder 
repairing home about extent of serious defects in house, a little depressing but we shall overcome, wife a bit upset.
\par Wednesday, up early before work to try and fix a water leak in wife\rquote s new old car, found leak but after 2 hours not enough time to repair 
it. At night came home to find my eldest daughter there, good discussion on finding solutions to step-daughter problem. Ie be firm and lay down regulations for last chance so as to lay ground rules for living at home and controlling her and our lives.

 into after effects of FMD on farmers, which showed that 95 per cent of farmers are staying in farming and developing and not taking up offers of retraining and moving away from farming. Discussion with several farmers and ex farmers in New
biggin village hall that they have or are going to give up farming. A lot of younger farmers know nothing else and don't want change but now they need to develop. Older farmers in particular are giving up, especially on the smaller farms, so at this time 
there are more farms coming up to let or sell than for a long time.\line On Saturday out of big quads at Greystoke Castle good to see hundreds of new lambs on Castle land Castle Farm was not affected by FMD, but or farms around it were (strange).\line

An interesting and active week. Regards FMD, received notice of meeting at Newbiggin village hall on Wednesday to discuss celebrations for Queen's Jubilee and how to spend \'a321,000 donated to 
village by refuse tip. Money donated because of inconvenience to village people (very nice for the village but is it really justified?) I am very disappointed I can't attend due to work commitments.\line

Usual busy working week, but arranged 2 evenings with son at home. He is seven years of age. On Monday played competition with son six games of his choice and he beat me fair and square, I gave him no leeway.\line 
During Monday my son went to Trotters Farm with the school, last year this was not possible because of FMD. Tuesday heard part of the debate on the 
radio re rural economy, I get the message that people not actually connected with farming, but making a living in farming areas, were greater affected by FMD than the farmers themselves. Wednesday finished work {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}

. Met a number of people in the lanes, chatting, missed this last year.  on Friday evening went to a wedding evening at the Shepherd's {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}Inn{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}Carlisle{\*\xmlclose}
. 50 percent of guests were from the farming community. Talking to farmer\rquote s 
son whose father gave up farming last year. He stated last year when his father got FMD they were very upset but after culling, his father asked him if he wanted the farm when he retired in 10 years. His reply was a definite No, he worked for his father o
n
 the farm because it was what his father wanted him to do. But he could see no future investing money in a farm for very little profit, working all hours. His father had said "OK then we sell up now". Both now very happy with life, and both very pleased w
ith now and the future. (FMD made the decision.)\line 
Reading in Saturday's CWH (local paper) front page story of a farmer giving up his farm due to FMD. Mentioned in the story (one line) son does not want to carry on farm. Reading between the lines, FMD helped 
make the decision to give up, not made them give up. The weekend paper was full of FMD stories, becoming boring reading. I can see farming changing, I hope we are able to keep farming in a small way, but I can see farms becoming larger to make profits, so
 it is the end of small farms. Who wants to work for a very poor income from a large investment

. We will see if this takes the stress off my partner. Stepdaughter will not work although jobs are offered her, and many excuses not to work, many promises. Repairs to home coming along slowly wet weather causing hold up \line

 to bed. On way to Clickham Inn met Malcolm Holmes foreman of Auction mart, Penrith, he was walking to. Clickham Inn.  Conversation with Malcolm (old friend). Quiet at auction with livestock and not now washing out as much
, before FMD he was finding it harder to work as hard as he used to, been with firm over 30 years now 51 years old, in their house. Was offered redundancy but only \'a3
12,500 so it did not take it but was tempted, if it had been double that would have, and mo
ved into father's smallholding, worked less and let his wife work full-time, (which she wants to do). but having to stay put because of pension at 60 years. Tired of washing out, although wearing waterproofs, you still get wet inside, crawling in and out 
of sheep trailers. Basically not enjoying his work as much as he did in past because getting old and washing out.\line 
Sunday at Oasis with little quads, for lunch went to Riding Stables at Oasis for bacon sandwich from butty van there. Talking to Alison Noble o
wner of riding stables. Said FMD did not affect her much financially only lost advanced riding (which she does little of) for 10 weeks. But got some money from FMD and bought butty van with it and a new quad, so actually financially better off. Also done 
HGV course\line 
. Summing up people are quickly adapting to new life after FMD crisis, a lot feel it has made them get out of a rut, some are wanting to live in the past, must look ahead. Unemployment in area 3 % which is for people between jobs and won't work.\line 
For everyone in today's society life is changing fast. During week there was a terrible smell blowing from east towards Flusco tip either Wildriggs slaughterhouse or pig farm starting up again at Hunter's opposite.

nday morning then  Jubilee  festivities at village hall (Mayday, sports day, barbecue and disco plus firework display) what could anyone ask for more. Many of these events had not been done for over two years. It was first class, everyone from the village
 
who was there enjoyed themselves, from toddlers to old-age pensioners, something for everybody. Only black spot of the day was informed in morning that stepdaughter was arrested for helping to beat up her boyfriend's mother, putting his mother in hospital

Tuesday Got up in morning to find myself weighing up 17 stone 6 the heaviest I've been since July 2001, must lose weight, let see what I can do. On Wednesday, enjoyed breakfast looking out across fields to Flus
co Pike, seeing cattle out, sunny morning, farm vehicles working in fields, country life looks good. Thursday up early started with Richard Selby a milkman at {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname time}{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Hour}{\xmlattrvalue 5}}
{\xmlattr\xmlattrns0{\xmlattrname Minute}{\xmlattrvalue 45}}}5:45am{\*\xmlclose} to revise his milk round in this area, going to do it next Monday and Tuesday. Support for
 milk man has gone down over the years, I had once upon a time a very large milk business, employing five people delivering  in Penrith area, got out before the big drop in supply and demand. One thing I noticed on Richard's milk round was that what custo
m
 he had was very loyal except three farms he supplied milk and papers to when I last did the round 20 months ago. One of these farms had once upon a time a house cow but wanted papers, so no milk, come FMD no house cow, but still wanted papers only, bough
t
 milk at supermarket. Farm 2 got milk and papers up to FMD and cancelled both never to return. Farm 3 had milk cows so no milk but got daily papers now no dairy cattle, buys milk from supermarket and no daily paper only Sunday paper now. Richard was a far
mer in the past (still many acres let off) gave much support to farmers and their families during FMD crisis which included financial help and Letters to the local paper. Farmers support for Richard - none.\line 
In general farmers are very short sighted, in the 
past when the Milk Marketing Board controlled the milk, farmers got a fair price, milk sales were encouraged on the doorstep not in supermarkets. Very little competition but very stable. A few years ago abolished MMB control, free for all, many farmers ea
r
ly winners, milk price control lost, result lower prices in supermarkets, good for housewife, but she now uses less milk (sales technique) milk used in supermarkets to entice customers in (lost leader) farmers' profits eventually cut, milk not wanted. The
 milkman encouraged sales but farmers envious of milk man's profits, result all losers. Farmers won't support their local business, they lose support of local people.\line 
Summing up, when it comes to money, people (notice people) mainly think of themselves busi
ness is business, sorry for the other person, but so what. Hard! Talking to people in general, who are not associated with farming, say they have heard enough about FMD and the farmers' plight, get on with  it.\line 
Thinking about it on Friday, someone needs to take control of farming and its future, planning ahead and updated contingency plans for the next outbreak. Saturday working at Oasis on mini quads, with student whose father worked for {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname PlaceName}}Greystoke{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname PlaceType}}Castle{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} until FMD outbreak then left Castle to make more mon
ey with DEFRA, no loyalty to long-term employer. Money speaks. Sunday A Day at home, ended up going to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}Carlisle{\*\xmlclose} area, more garden centres.\line 
Milk in supermarkets is very rarely from local farms, can be from abroad.\line Looking forward to meetings, if in mood will open discussion.

With time everything changes, in the same way farming is now changing rapidly, probably for the better. Talking with a local vet he had a very ba
d year with FMD (that is financially), but has now found more time to be with his family and have holidays, says he likes it better without the pressure, he stated also that not all farms had restocked, hence he was not as required, also many older farmer
s seem to be retiring early, and land also let off.\line 
Listen to a lot of farming on Radio 4 in early hours of morning, FMD still mentioned, formed my own views on it, which were confirmed by the vet, farmers lived in a regular routine fairly safe and steady, 
FMD changed that, the ones with any sense took the money and rethought,  the unlucky ones were left behind.\line Spent two days working for {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname PlaceName}}Greystoke{\*\xmlclose}

around, very impressed with the clean tidy and in some ways attractive site. Much rain this week, so water in tip (old quarry) so water was  very deep, this must seep into water table and away underground. The impression on inspection of the tip appeared 
t
o my untrained eye, was that the tip was very well managed and I feel no concern. My daughter is an EHO who states the present standards are very high (more detail can be given from the horse's mouth.) if questions asked at any meetings and answers are no

People seem to talk about FMD less and less with time, but came across a young man (learning to drive) who stated his mother had 50 pet sheep, whi

 sheep whatsoever because the trauma was too much for her. But she now has pet cattle.\line 
Taking landlady from a local pub, I asked her if people talk about FMD now. She stated locals are very very rare, only people mentioning it are visitors, who keep saying 
"you must have had that terrible year, last year, because of FMD." a landlady said "I wish they would shut up about it."\line On Sunday for the first time we allowed }{\f0\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\f0\fs24\insrsid14616386

Chance of a perfect building plot at Greystoke Gill, to build a detached house in character style, could raise money, but would ta

Some time off work during the week, spent much of this spare time doing house maintenance. Noticed activity at Flusco tip, working at the closest point nearest to my home. No smells at any time, even with hot weather. One half
 day a very heavy rain, tip is much higher than house, water running from that direction across field into our rear garden, drain hole blocked, water built up to doorstep, water strange brown colour darker than past similar events.\line 
We regards FMD, two cont
acts with persons affected by it. One vet, who lost a lot of business due to FMD, worked for DEFRA , made up money, but now less animals for his service, but building up slowly again. Started a new learner from farm I used to visit a lot over the years, b
u
t had not been there since FMD outbreak. Farm very quiet, no livestock about since FMD. Strange feeling, was always a busy place. None of farming family (three) working at home. Daughter's starting to learn to drive a year late, could not start last year 
when she was 17 because she said she found it difficult to leave farm due to FMD and then put it off.\line 
On Wednesday working with a student at Oasis doing mini quads, he did this last year, worked many hours for Greystoke Castle, because normal full-time staf
f left the castle to work for DEFRA and make better money, which meant he worked more hours than this year, so liked the money. His father worked for {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname PlaceName}}Greystoke{\*\xmlclose} 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname PlaceType}}Castle{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} for many years but due to FMD was unable to work as many hours at the Castle, so left for DEFRA never to return, started work elsewhere and settled at new occupation.\line

\par }{\fs24\insrsid14616386 A very varied week with a lot happening, which is what I like, I enjoy problems and solutions.
\par Monday a long working day with L Drivers, on one long drive, in evening, listening to car radio, an interesting history of the ambulance service and its development from redflock body 
taxis to present highly skilled paramedics. The main factor in the development of the ambulance service was in the late Sixties and early Seventies when two doctors saw the potential of the service and put their minds together to improve it and develop it
.
 (this came about after a major disaster and the ambulance service was not organised) so you could relate this to farming this FMD was a very major disaster, so leaders need to put their heads together and work out a future, for the benefit of the farming
 community and people around the community. Reading an article with Margaret Beckett (Ministry of Agriculture)  it would appear she's working along these lines, putting long-term thought into it, not stop-gap actions.

Friday, daytime spent at Crook, Kendal with Driving Improvement. People from all walks of life on these courses but no farmers. Had to use a lot of encouragement with an instructor to do some classroom ins

\par A busy and interesting week (and lot of thoughts) \line 
The week started with driver improvement course for one-and-a-half days. Mentioned FMD to them, they showed no interest. During the week heard (radio) and read of discontent of farmers and auctions with animal movement orders i e 20 d
ay wait does seem a bit hard on farmers, so I hope common sense will prevail.\line 
Wednesday the 7th went with my eldest daughter Deborah or to Dalston village hall for social meeting. Very good evening, we both enjoyed it. I enjoyed the way we were introduced 
to one another, and conversation was encouraged to flow (a good sign was I didn't want to go home) very interesting people and I learned a lot, over the past few days thinking about what had been said, understanding some of the problems many of the farmin
g community and associated industries have had and having.\line 
Business head - if a business is not financially sound i e losing money and no great future, why not get out and move on? The business left will grow stronger. Help is much needed in strong advice and less sympathy, to make a better future for all.\line 
I learned a lot about world problems, it is very sad to hear of anyone in terrible conditions, but when it is millions of people, it is worse than tragic, words can't describe how I feel.
\par My youngest daugh
ter (Emma) and her husband, recently toured the world, spending much of their time off the beaten track. The happiest and most content people they met were in Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in the world, they were just happy to be alive and well. 
How can we help the starving millions, we are not allowed to interfere with the politics of the country. Education and gentle advice. Maybe the Western world losing some of its greed for money and power.
\par The same for FMD sufferers. Sympathy and education for a better future, throwing money at it won't help. Confused.

My week is now reduced 
to 3 full (13+) hours days of learner teaching, mixed with 2 late evening and 2 early mornings of learners, 2 full days,(12 hours) of quad bikes for Greystoke Castle and now one day off completely. A good variety of work with much more leisure. Contact wi

\par Met farmer on holiday at Oasis Village, he was complaining of loss of profit, farming not paying at present time, he was not directly affected by FMD (from Scotland). Stated big changes need to be made in futur

 went for a pint to the local pub, got caught up in company, a pint became many more, no mention of FMD. Quite a bit of excitement for Skelton Show, several locals going there, including landlord with his classic tractor for
 showing, all excited about the coming show. No show last year.
\par Much work in area for holiday trade, shortage of workers. Persuaded step-daughter to start work At the local travel Lodge as chambermaid, she has not worked for nearly a year, we will see how 
long this will last.  Had to use a great deal of tact. Many more visitors this year after FMD. Plenty of work the result in the holiday trade.

At night (Wednesday) in local pub for a bedtime pint, talk about Skelton show which had been on at the weekend, the landlord had shown his two old tractors, very interesting, a big show but no animals because of present animal restrict
ions, this did not dampen the show, people still enjoyed it.\line Saturday at Oasis with mini quads, much rain, people enjoying themselves getting muddy and wet, this is all thanks to FMD, not held at Oasis until outbreak.\line 
During the week often listen to Archers on Radio 4, diversify seems to be the key word, farmers have to change.\line Went for a walk up to the tip, everything very neat and tidy, no smells drifting towards house unless I have no sense of smell.\line 
Cattle in field between house and tip, full of cattle

Week beginning 26th August, 2002. A very mixed week. Usual workload, but Monday Bank Holiday off, spent day catching up on of jobs, and great deal to be done, spent some time with family, very enjoyable (partner gets stressed easily )\line 
Tuesday and Wednesday learner driving full days, making up for day off. Flies appearing in house and out side, big nuisance, partner bought flypaper (sticky) caught many. (not seen this number of flies before at Newbiggin in past three years)\line 
Thursday and Friday half day learn
ers and half day Driving Improvement, the group for driver improvement, were at first very difficult, but I was very pleased by the end of the session. Had got their confidence and they said they had learnt a lot but also enjoyed it at the finish.\line 
In the local pub Thursday evening for half-an-hour. Number of farmers, no mention of FMD, life seemed good with them.\line 
Started a farmer's daughter from Long Marton, Kirby Thore for learner driving lessons. She stated they had FMD last year and were cleaned out, but it had not really bothered her dad. She was a Cannon, probably related to me through my mother's side.\line 
Saturday went to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}Carlisle{\*\xmlclose}, place very busy, partner got stressed, I think with the number of people and no clothes in the shop suitable for her. Colder 
days so not as many flies about home, but still some, we had to keep the windows closed during the week. Saturday-night went for a bike ride, lots of flies and midges about,  itching when back home, took a late shower to stop itching, a few bites, which i
s strange for me as usually they leave me alone. Sunday Oasis pleasure park, mini quad lessons, }{\f0\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\f0\fs24\insrsid14616386  with me for two hours, let him have a ride.\line

Spend a little more time with wife and family. I've noticed since spring i e 2001 since not been able to sail for a few months, I seem to have lost interest, it once overruled my total leisure time. Done approximately for 10/12 years.\line 
On Saturday 7th September, in CWH ({\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Cumberland{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 and Westmorland Herald) saw report on FMD started to read it, but lost interest. (yes it was financially tragic for many, but that his life)
 is very good to see that they are trying to prepare for a better future, i e prepared and preparing contingency plans and effects on people and their lives. The big thing about FMD lot of it is a tragedy controlled by men to prevent a tragedy.\line 
Sunday read report again in CWH but again lost interest. Sunday evening out with farming community, but no mention of FMD in the whole evening, many there were severely affected by the outbreak.

s. Mostly a very cold week, mostly below freezing point.  On 2 of the days in the morning, there was a smell of gas from the tip (strong smell) and one day the smell of the tip itself, these, smells were on days when there was no or very little wind. I ha
v
e been informed that there is gas which comes naturally from the tip but is usually burned off. The tip smell from the rubbish is probably from the workers at the tip disturbing rubbish near to our house. I've noticed that at times they are working late i
nto the night.\line 
Sunday 12th January, out playing darts at Blencow, playing against one of the senior men in the NFU and his two boys. He is a sheep farmer mainly, with him were also other farm lads. A year ago or less listening to them, last year was all abo
ut FMD, this time that not even a mention, except myself mentioning it, lightly, "it's history now!" was the reply. Very rarely does one hear FMD mentioned when out in the local country pubs. I see the odd mention in the press, but that's all.\line 
Rather funny
, my close friend, who is a farmer, gave up farming during FMD. Saying it he would never go back to it, enjoying life without farming. Now as a hobby, he has bought 200 sheep and dealt in a few beasts (just as a hobby). Farming is in the blood.

\par Saturday, in local paper Cumberland and Westmorland Herald, saw picture of Will Cockbain, NFU chairman for Cumbria, campaigning for movement restrictions for animals to cease or be brought up to date
, small demonstration of farmers at DEFRA Animal Health office in Carlisle. It would appear to me the farmers need to be more assertive/aggressive, in their stance. No smells from the tip this week, many days of high winds.\line 
Saturday spent four hours on 4 x
 4 (Land-Rover) with a couple from Yorkshire Dales. The woman was a teacher, but was very into sheep, keeping different breeds on her smallholding, drives several miles each day to school. Wanted to be taught about 4 x 4 driving, very good, interesting. S
he never once mentioned FMD, although she must have been affected by it.\line Sunday no work except to lessons in morning. Evening darts singles in the local pub very busy, again at no mention of FMD, life seems to be as normal, ie before FMD.

\par The usual busy week. Noticed the tip workings are very close, had a walk up to Flusco Pike, the tip appeared very tidy. No smells from the tip at all this week, weather mainly wet and windy.
\par Talking to an instructor from Carlisle, whose husband and family
 were farming towards Wigton way. Her husband had taken a nervous breakdown after FMD. They were milking 100 cows, worried constantly about FMD but did not get it. The constant worry got him down, not knowing from day to day, she stated it would have been
 better if they had got it and done with, then it\rquote 
s done and finished with. Due to his nerves, he decided February 2002 to give up and sell up. Much much happier realising there is more to life than seven days working, for what? Happy now working two days d
riving minibuses. She is the breadwinner and enjoying it, he now complains she's not off to go away, the roles are reversed. She stated they found it difficult wondering when it would hit them. Bought a fresh driving school vehicle this week, the first se
cond-hand vehicle for 16 years. Car prices are very depressed at the moment, especially second hand, garages with too large a stock of second-hand vehicles losing money if not turned over quickly, time to buy.
\par Saturday guess what, shopping Kendal, shops busy a few visitors about.\line 
Much of my spare time has been taken up with getting used to the internet and arranging new banking. Wish I had done this years ago, can now see benefit of modern technology. Talking to a few farming folk and reading between the lin
es, they realise that FMD has made them look forward, the hard way.

\par Out with my friend the ex-farmer, who is now happy with life since
 FMD, a lot has happened to him in two years, he says his quality of life has improved considerably. He was milking 100 cows, which took him most of the day as he needed to update his farming methods. He said he was talking recently to his neighbouring fa

ubbish tipped. Visited site, saw much improvements i e new filter beds for water out of tip. I will be able in a few weeks' time have a better knowledge of the smell and pollution from Flusco tip, as my youngest daughter Emma will have taken up the positi
on of EHO for pollution in the local Eden District Council  (inside information!).
\par Usual busy week with a variety of work involving instruction, but feeding terrible, because of a very heavy cold, wanted to be anywhere but in the car with problem learners, 
I don't give my best attention, so I feel I have not given value for money, they don't know but I do. Tuesday doing Driving Improvement, one of the clients, who was from away went on about FMD in Cumbria and how bad it was for us all, the other two in the
 car were not interested. But it was interesting to hear the thoughts and opinions of someone from away. He tended to think everyone in Cumbria was affected not just farmers and the tourist industry, this was the picture portrayed him by the press.\line 
Friday, felt a little better, short working day as it was }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 's 8th birthday, went to bowling alley at Carlisle with six of his friends, all had colds. A pleasant evening.

\par Usual busy week working 12 hour days plus. Thursday 20th with driving Services on Driving Improvement, two of the young men
 in the car had worked on the FMD crisis, they said it was in their words "a good laugh, and great money."  After the crisis one of the young men was paid to be retrained, choosing to be a heavy goods driver, going on a course paid by the FMD fund. He too
k
 advantage of it, but after three months on the road did not like it. (his driving was terrible, unsafe, needed a different attitude to driving.) They talked a lot about what they did during the crisis, which appeared to be not a lot. They were both from 
farming backgrounds.\line 
Saturday the 22nd out for dinner at Brantwood Hotel, Tempest  dinner sailing club. Talking to one of the locals from Stainton, on about the other pub in Stainton, Kings Arms, the landlord of this other pub is not very well liked and bec
ause of his attitude very few locals go in, preferring Brantwood Hotel instead. This landlord (from King's Arms) was often complaining about farmers taking advantage of FMD funds, but he himself had the pub refurbished with FMD money, although his custom 
went down not because of FMD but his attitude to locals and visitors. (one has to visit and observe it is an education on how not to deal with customers) it is felt he certainly took advantage.

him support. Carlisle Lodge was non-agricultural, so humour was different, prefer mixture of people, will take him to Wigton or Appleby next.
\par My friend the ex or nearly ex farmer is at present on holiday abroad, second time in six months, he very rarel

\par Evening on Sunday out with friends at darts at Royal Oak, Dockray. Lack of locals in pub, in past was n nightly meeting place for local folks includin
g farmers, now very few go in. Lost to Travellers from Glenridding, good game. (played on neutral board) talking to the farmer friend, returned from holiday, when dropping me off at home, he was leaving me at 10.45 p m. to go off and check his sheep (
200) because of lambing time. We discussed if it was worth it, cost of sheep and upkeep, profit from lambs and grants given, it would take two years to break even before a profit, NOT COUNTING HIS TIME, small is absolutely no good. This will be the end of
 
sheep and probably the end of his venture back into farming, he would be better off using his time elsewhere, and he's not enjoying it. His son is far happier off the farm making far more money for himself and enjoying life. Small farmers are kidding them
selves, big is the only way. FMD was traumatic for }{\fs24\insrsid9574030 [him]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  but in the long term benefited him, both financially and health wise.\line

\par Weekdays jam packed with learners 12 hours plus per day. Saying no to new 
work but very difficult especially with people I know. Very sad news on Wednesday, no not the Gulf war, but my friend P who I have been encouraging to become a driving instructor and whom I have given loads of work and assistance, failed for the third tim
e
 his part three of the DSA instructors exam, which means he cannot instruct any more for money as from now. My plan was to give him at least two days' work a week. It is sad, he has proved to be a good instructor but cannot play act with the examiner.  A 
good instructor wasted, because of red tape. (sad)\line 
Saturday at home until 1pm then Greystoke Castle with big quads, an excellent group of women on a trek, they absolutely enjoyed it, which made my day. (women are far more enjoyable to instruct than men) the
 reason takes a long explanation. Saturday evening out for a meal with }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  and }{\fs24\insrsid353523 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 , at Clickham Inn, busy, pleasant evening. Sunday off to York, }{
\fs24\insrsid353523 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  sister's home and guess what, shops. }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  and myself escaped off when shopping, we enjoyed ourselves.
\par This is the week when my youngest daughter takes over her new position as an EHO for pollution in Eden District. (she is now responsible for the tip.)
\par No smell from tip, visited site during week and found it very clean and tidy. The only smell
 from nearby farm, but it is the country. Good to see farms working, number of lambs, but not as many as past years. It would appear small farms have not recovered or don't know what to do next

\par Usual busy week with learner driving, refuse
d much work. Thinking back two years ago, I was busy then but not as much as this year. Two years ago I was doing a one day a week from Newton Rigg College, with farmers sons or students on other courses. At present I have only one person from Newton Rigg
 
and she is local. It takes time to break into a new place and get your name known, with FMD the work I had at Newton Rigg stopped dead, and I have never picked up there. The fact is I am busy without it, but it shows how once you lose somewhere it is hard
 
to return. Worked 12/14 hours per week day. Saturday morning only with Sat afternoon off. Sunday all day 11 hours at OASIS mini quads for Greystoke Castle. Wife complaining I overwork, so refusing all new enquiries. Enjoying what little time at home. FMD 
M not mentioned anywhere, noticed lambing time not as busy as previous years but up on last year.

\par Another busy week with L Drivers, one evening off on Thursday went to a Mark (?)
 Masonic evening, interesting to notice a great number of farmers there, especially from the Eden Valley area, two years ago that they were missing almost completely, last year not as many, but now they are back in full force, good to see and hear the goo
d
 humour, no depressing remarks with regards FMD, in fact FMD was never mentioned. Weekend, Saturday off doing a do-it-yourself around the house, Sunday mini quads at Oasis, good day. Apart from a cold everyone at home healthy and happy, looking forward to
 the future. No smells from the refuse tip.

\par Saturday 12th, big quads at Greystoke Castle, to very good treks, (paid for enjoyment). Evening in Clickham Inn with }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 , a couple of pints game of pool cycle home. A very good day.\line 
Sunday 13th, Kendal in morning with L Driver, afternoon off with family, }{\fs24\insrsid353523 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  in a ratty mood, just women.\line No smell

\par mixed up week  very interesting. Monday, Tuesday busy 14 hour days with L Drivers. Wednesday 16th April at Oasis with mini quads, working with a chap
 called B, very interesting, he worked for Greystoke Castle up to FMD outbreak, then left for more money to help with FMD, made a tidy income very happy with FMD pay. Now back at Greystoke Castle, but also selling boreholes for water in north-west region,
 to farmers, beginning to find a new business developing fast, massive savings can be made by farmers, only problem takes an average eight months to cover the paperwork, but only at the most 1 week to put borehole in.
\par Thursday Busy with L Drivers
\par Good Friday, finished at 3:30pm, went out 7 p m. to Clickham Inn with }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 
, very busy at pub talking to landlady, Maggie, who stated it was the busiest they had been since FMD (In two years). (no doubt people staying in this country due to sun and Iraqi war.)
\par Cycled home after a few pints and good crack, content with the world.
\par Saturday forced to go to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}Carlisle{\*\xmlclose} shopping, busy and boring, but }{\fs24\insrsid353523 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 
 has no clothes to wear, trailed around all the shops, but there was only one top that was suitable. No doubt I wi
ll have to suffer the shops again sometime. Sunday, Greystoke Castle with big quads very interesting, evening relaxing at home. Good to see lambs on the estate, bit of a nuisance when lambs start following quads. Guests think it is great, much wildlife ab
out which pleased everyone.
\par Reflecting back, vacancies came up at Greystoke Castle due to his part-time employees leaving to help with FMD. Otherwise I would not have known about Greystoke Castle. Work I enjoy. During the week each day smells. Not from the 
tip but from pig farm opposite. Very hot and dry week.

\par Easter week. Easter Monday worked morning, afternoon, Tempest sail boat taken to Ullswater, usual problems ie snags could not put it on the water, enjoyed messing about, wi
th son-in-law and brother-in-law, deal struck between them two regarding purchase of a building plot at Greystoke Ghyll (prime location), at a price. Wish it was me. But fed-up of the tread-mill always looking for money, I will curse myself in a few years
 time, must think simple.
\par Tuesday to Friday 4 hour days with Learners. No time for anything else. Friday sister-in-law (partner\rquote s sister) and her son came to us from York. Good company the boy is  a real city-boy, clothes useless to go out in, street-cred f
or a city but a dick-head in the country.
\par Could not take him anywhere due to his baggy clothes and footwear 3 (three) sizes too big. A silly 14 year old, no thought, but a nice lad.
\par Saturday at Oasis with mini-quads, late start but good company and enjoyable day, out at night with family to Blencow pub, for a meal, good meal and company, good crack with locals.
\par Sunday ran visitors to Langwathby Railway station at 9.30 am, rest of day at Ullswater, with son-in-law, fantastic sail, it was much too windy for a 1}{\fs24\super\insrsid14616386 st}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 
 sail with a strange boat, but we went out. NO WORDS can describe the thrill, will find time to sail more this year. Looking back it was the outbreak of FMD which stopped me sailing for several months in which time I started working more, never picking
 up sailing again as much. But now, no stopping me.
\par Went to bed very content with life.
\par Read in local paper, CWH, that a farmer at Eamont Bridge had been fined several thousand pounds for releasing effluent into the river Eamont, he blamed FMD and the money he lost for this. I don\rquote t see how FMD made him do this !!
\par No smells from the tip, much work is going on, tip very tidy.
\par Lovely to watch the cows and young calves in the field behind us.
\par Life looks good

\par Saturday 3 May, excellent day, no work, to Ullswater 7.15 am, preparing tempest dinghy for sailing. Very windy so worked on boat preparing it for racing. A very (the most) experienced sailor on Ullswater went over in a very safe boat, winds gusti
ng up to 40 knots which is very hard indeed, spent whole day there with son-in-law and my }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 , }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  made new friend. Home at night, }{\fs24\insrsid353523 
[wife]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  at work, eldest daughter D turned up with photos to prepare a \'93This is Your Life\'94 album for youngest daugh
ter E. Very interesting looking at the past (what will the future bring) Sunday dragged to Carlisle shopping (I wish some disease would break out in the shops, banning all shopping, Foot and Pocket!)
\par Pleasant evening at home.
\par This week again no smells from the tip, only normal farm smells. Took a look at the tip, appears very tidy, always a lot of activity at tip, looks well organised.

 old school friends and catch up with the past and future with them. Taught most of them to drive, wonderful girls, saw them grow up and develop into fine young women, often agony uncle to them, lovely memories. But more interesting finding out
 what they are doing now. Great morning and midday. Afternoon on patriot vehicle with shooting games, very interesting. 5pm a learner lesson with someone who had booked it in January, put a little extra into it, she enjoyed it, left me on a high.

\par Windy rainy week, no smell from tip. No mention of FMD except travelling through Johnby and thought of my friend and his farm at Johnby hall Farm, now left, sad to see it as it is, destroyed after FMD. He\rquote s moved on and developed, best off he

\par Very similar to previous week, very enjoyable. Mainly learner lessons, but hours less than last year, but still want to work less.
\par Managed to go sailing once in week, Saturday. }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  had his 3}{\fs24\super\insrsid14616386 rd}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 
 topper sailing lesson, bought a second-hand topper for him, he sailed it on his own for the first time, he\rquote s talked non-stop about sailing. Pleased to see his present interests are: rugby league on a Thurs
day night, sailing, swimming, and also his computer. Mixture of friends from all walks of life, making him a better person. Saturday spent all day with family.
\par Sunday Oasis mini-quads, took }{\fs24\insrsid2976233 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  with me until 10am, he enjoyed riding quads about and helping out. }{\fs24\insrsid353523 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 
 worried about her daughter, went out on Saturday night just before midnight for a night out, took 5 hours to get ready. Did not return home, did not turn in for work at 9am at Travel Lodge, she has been formally cautioned twice, so unless a
 good excuse could be out of a job, unless they are desperate for workers. }{\fs24\insrsid353523 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid14616386  worries terrible about her. }{\fs24\ul\insrsid14616386 Time will tell.}{\fs24\insrsid14616386 
\par No smells from tip or flies. At Ullswater on Wednesday night, bitten very badly by midges, never bitten before in my life, suffered since with like heat spots on my head, face and arms, bit of a nuisance, will find some sort of a repellent for the future.

\par Read in CWH about taxman after farmers and FMD payments. Where did the money go? There will be a few worried farmers.

Friday, full day learners, finishing at 9.45pm. Saturday mixture of learners and Greystoke C
astle, partner complaining. But Sunday, day at home with her, she was very depressed, wish I was at work (not really). Life appears normal in the countryside. No smell from refuse tip, only smell from farms, which is not a bad thing. Village hall looking

\fs24\insrsid14616386  sailing I was conversing with a senior member of the club, who stated that during the summer of FMD the club nearly folded, from assets of well over \'a3
100,000 was in the red, due to late session start, extra costs and many members stopped coming.
\par The club has just recovered from that bad year. Sunday racing Tempest in a three event. Di
d very well considering first time racing the boat, very enjoyable. After end of racing a few pints, but attacked by midges, once again having to suffer for a few days with bites (own fault not using cream)
\par Warm week but no smell from rubbish tip. A lot of young livestock in field behind us, enjoyable watching antics of such animals.

s pleased with result, she was in much better mood, she is very into gardens, hard to please her with gardening, so got something right. Sunday mini-quads at CenterParcs, long day, back home at night for barbecue.
\par Learnt, (listened to a conversation), rather disturbing: Licence to incinerate fallen stock (renewal) when inspected by vet, local council and other interested bodies, incinerator not licensed or up to standard, bodies of dead animals were left for 
weeks in skips before burning, spinal cords of beef animals not disposed of correctly etc. All but one of visiting group were happy to renew his licence because he was a nice chap. Is it not this sloppy behaviour by the farming community that creates prob
