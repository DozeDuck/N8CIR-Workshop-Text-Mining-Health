 - Plenty of livestock to move but just normal fighting all day to get licences.  We always get there before the day is out but it is getting frustrating that it takes you all day to get there.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid13964281 Tuesday}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  - I left the yard at 07.00 with a wagon.  Going to Pe
rth for a load of sheep.  It's nice to get away from the phones and get peace and see the countryside.  It's nice to go into Scotland and see things looking normal.  Rather than going South and seeing the scars in the fields where piers have been.  A cons
tant reminder of a short time ago.
\par I was talking to the Trading Standards officer while I was loading.  She told me the rules in Scotland were changing "more rules to get used to".  You just get used to one set of rules then they change.  A lot of the time for the worse.
\par When I got back to the office mayhem.  I had organised a load of sheep to come from Belgium to Cumbria. Officials in Dover were not happy because they had not received the paperwork from Belgium.  When the animals have been vet}{\fs24\insrsid5066474 t}{
\fs24\insrsid13964281 ed in Belgium the vet has to stamp the papers and fax them to Dover so they can issue a licence for the livestock to travel in Britain.  The vehicle was sailing a
t 21.00.  It made the boat with 10 minutes to spare after a lot of phone calls and persuasion.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid13964281 Wednesday}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  - The lads arrived back from Belgium mid morning.  All the fuss had been in Dover.  The DEFRA official in Dover told them he didn't really know what w
as required.  If he doesn't know how are we meant to know.  After all it's them making the rules.
\par When we washed the vehicle out there had to be a MLC (?) official and a vet to pass it clean. The vet had forgotten his official stamp so he put his thumbprint on the form and signed it.  What chance have you got.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid13964281 Thursday}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  - Delivered sheep to 2 farms at Waterbeck and Canobie.  Nice to see happy faces.  Would have talked all  day but about the weather and DEFRA.  When I presented the licences to the farmers I 
was surprised in a way they didn't know what they had to do with them.  There are so many different areas nobody is sure they are right or wrong.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid13964281 Friday}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  - Organising a load of cattle out of Belgium for next week.  I phoned Belgium and Dover for some guida
nce.  For once I got somebody with sense in Dover.  He faxed me an authorisation number for the licence so the driver could fax everything himself from Belgium.  Done everything I can now hope everything will be ok this next week.

anised, hopefully the wagon set for Belgium, fingers crossed. Restocking a farm in Cumbria tomorrow, no licences so I phoned DEFRA. The livestock was coming from four different farms four different vehicles from all over the country. When I got hold of th
e right person at DEFRA he had faxed the licences to the wrong Vets. He faxed them to the right Vets so we could set the vehicles off.
\par 
\par Tuesday
\par All the licences arrived in the right place so the farmer at Hutton roof is very pleased. He is excited about get
ting animals back on his farm after so long. Leading up to a movement the farmers get cross and frustrated with all the officialdom but when everything eventually falls into place it seems to add to the excitement, either that or it is just relief at last
 they can get on with their normal working lives. 
\par 
\par Wednesday
\par A good friend of mine was getting his first cows home today. In the morning he was up to high do panicking did he have the right licences, was the transport in place and running on time. By night
 he was over the moon, cows home, everything ok. He said it was great to hear cows beckoning in the buildings again.
\par The wagon arrived from Belgium ok and the farmer was very happy with his cattle.

\par Fax machine is red hot today. A whole new set of rules coming out for spring. Reading the new regulations, it should make life a lot easier. Some rules are good but some are silly, just what was expected. It seems to me these people making these rules don
\rquote t trust anybody and think they have no common sense. Maybe if they tried talking to people who have to use these rules, life could be easier for everybody. They might even get a bit of respect.

\par I\rquote ve got my son this weekend. Me and a few friends went kart racing, we were practising for going to Manchester in two weeks time, we are in the finals of the }{\fs24\insrsid16677158 Marie Curie}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  karting challenge. It\rquote

\par I went to Lanark today for a load of sheep. I thought things would be easier today. Loading the sheep was but all the restrictions as far as paperwork is concerned are still in place in Scotland but not in England.
\par When I got back from Lanark I made some enquiries about the new rules; things are easier but still very restricted.
\par 
\par Tuesday
\par I got a phone call from one of the girls I work with at Penrith. It was great to hear from her and find out what everybody had been up to in the last six months. The sting in the tail of the phone call was DEFRA were still trying t
o sort a claim out from the Cull last April. I had to go and hunt paperwork out they needed. I find it hard to believe claims are still being sorted out-I also find it hard to believe a farmer could sit back for 10 months and then ask for payment for his 
livestock. It makes you sit and think how long this will go on for?
\par 
\par Wednesday
\par Things are fairly quiet today, everything going well for a change. Spent most of the day phoning different ferry companies for prices and reviews because of the time that has lapsed since we used them regularly.
\par 
\par Thursday
\par A lot of livestock moving today. Some for slaughter, some from restocking, some just extra stock on farms, some from England to Scotland and vice versa. You need a license for some and not for others. Spent a lot
 of time on the phone to local officers of the areas the livestock was coming from. Things weren\rquote t too bad everybody I spoke to could give me an answer straight away.

\par I have another wagon in Belgium today it went away yesterday and drove right to 
the first farm in Belgium. The two drivers need al their tome to reach the farm accurately for delivery; it is the first load to come into Scotland because of the travelling times allowed. I got a phone call at 13.00; the driver in Belgium has a problem w
ith paperwork but didn\rquote t do anything about it, so the wagon didn\rquote t get on the ferry. The regular people in Dover were off today and the ones that were there didn\rquote t know what they had to do, so they didn\rquote 
t phone authorisation through in time. I phoned my cus
tomer in Carluke he gave me a number for a man in Seerad headquarters in Edinburgh. I phoned the man in Edinburgh and explained what had happened. He said to me to leave it with him and he would get back to me in the next ten minutes. Five minutes later t
h
e phone rang, I was surprised it was the man in Edinburgh, he told me the head welfare officer from DEFRA in London would phone me. I had hardly put the phone down when the man from London phoned, I was frustrated and angry so he got it full pelt. Once I 
h
ad got it off my chest and calmed down a bit he got the chance to speak. After all this time I was actually speaking to somebody that understood and knew what you were talking about. I spoke to him for about half an hour. He was sympathetic with a lot of 
problems we had and promised to look into them. He also assured me the people in Dover would be disciplined and learned the proceeding properly so it wouldn\rquote t happen again. \'93We will wait and see\'94
\par 
\par Saturday
\par 3.30 am the phone rang, the drivers were back from Belgium. I had arranged for them to ring when they got home because they wouldn\rquote t get the ferry they were meant to they didn\rquote 
t have time to deliver the sheep. As we had used all our own drivers on the Frid
ay I had to go and deliver the sheep. When I got to Carluke the farmer was pleased 1. Because he eventually got his sheep and 2. Because they had travelled well. He said that despite all the hassle of the last month it was a relief the sheep were home. I 
am full of cold but feel quite good after seeing and hearing the farmer.
\par When I got home 10.30 I went to Andrew, my friend who has a farm. I went to collect his sheep that I fetched from Iscay in January. This was the last of his livestock home. That was hi
m fully restocked. It was nice to walk round the farm and see livestock in the sheds. He had some cows and calves. The calves suckling their mothers and shipping round the shed was so good to see especially when only six months ago there was nothing but e
mptiness. The farm seemed alive again.
\par 
\par Sunday
\par Didn\rquote t get up till late, feel crap, full of cold. Laid about and played games with my son. As the day went on I felt a bit better. Say thinking \'93wonder what next will bring\'94. As usual the weekends don\rquote t seem to last very long.

\par Trying to get to grips with these new rules. It\rquote s a bit of a nightmare really. Everybody is confused at what you can do and what you can\rquote t do. The rules seem so stupid.
\par We are trying to organise to fetch sheep to Longtown for the first live sale tomorrow, but it is difficult. We have sheep coming from Perth but the timing is difficult. The market won\rquote t be open until 6.00 that\rquote

\par First live sale in Longtown today. It was nice t
o hear the echo around the yard of the auctioneer. 18 months ago I never really noticed it but today the sound was a lot more distinct. Every time I walked out of the office it was the first thing I heard. Some of the rules seem to be very stupid everybod
y knows foot and mouth is a airborne virus, but despite this before anybody could enter the office or the canteen they had to wash their hands. Also a wagon driver or a driver couldn\rquote 
t wash their hands in the same basin as a farmer. Once their hands were washed they could go to the office, handle the same paper, talk to the same person, then go and have their dinner together in the canteen! 
\par 
\par Friday
\par Things are not so busy today so I was on a wagon for a while. I went to Hexham to load cattle. There were thre
e men on the gates in and out of the market. I had to fill a form in before I could get in the market. About cleansing and disinfecting the wagon. The only thing was he never asked yet where the wagon was getting cleansed. When I got in to the market ther
e was one man and he didn\rquote t care who\rquote 
s cattle I got as long as the market was empty. There was no paper work with the cattle so therefore very little traceability. It is so frustrating you try and do everything right and sensible but the ones that make the rules don\rquote t seem to care.

\par 
\par Saturday
\par Brian, a good friend of mine called in to see me today. We sat and talked about things that had happened while foot and mouth was in its height. Brian worked on the \'85\'85\'85 cull on the Scotch side while I was working this side of the border.
\par We were comparing stories in a way and laughing at things that normally you wouldn\rquote t laugh at, but as the saying goes if you didn\rquote t laugh you would cry.
\par 
\par Sunday
\par Went to Manchester for the }{\fs24\insrsid16677158 Marie Curie}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 Karting final. Five of us went to Manchester, it was a great place and a great racing circuit but the karts were rubbish. Despite that we had a great day and a good laugh. I wasn\rquote 
t very well coming home I think it must have been the fumes. I had a headache and bad stomach, as soon as I got home I went to bed.

\par 
\par Tuesday
\par Busy at work today, more and more farmers phoning wanting livestock fetched from various parts of the country, things seem to be looking better.
\par I watched a programme on TV about the year of Foot and Mouth. I watched as all the thoughts of nearly a year ago came flooding back. Seeing people I knew and their livestock on piers fetched a tear to my eye.
\par After that on the news two sheep found with legions in their mouths. All you can think is not again. 
\par After watching that programme then seeing the news and thinking of all the horrific things that happened and to think it could be happening again doesn\rquote 
t bear thinking about. Just when you think things are getting better you kicked in the teeth again.
\par A lot of people accused people of making a lot of money out of foot and mouth at the time. Yes, a lot of people did make money but for the work that they had done they needed paying for it.
\par I sat at home thinking tonight yes I made money but I wouldn\rquote t go through it again not even if they paid me ten times as much. It\rquote s not the money it\rquote s the animals-the people-the livelihoods-the life. Put all that together you can
\rquote t put a price on the way of life. All the money just helped people to try and build that way of life. To think this disease might be coming back is bound to put everybody in the livestock industry in turmoil. Fingers crossed it\rquote 
s a false alarm.
\par 
\par Wednesday
\par Everybody breaths a big sigh of relief the first blood tests have come back negative. There seems to be light at the end of the tunnel again.
\par I sent a wagon to Hexham today for a load of sheep. There were four lots in Hexham Mart and three on farms all supposed to be DERFA approved and when the wagon got to Hexham and out the sheep on there trading standards would not let him go to
 the farms. If he had gone to the farms first and then to Hexham there would have been no problem. I had to send another wagon to the farms. So the job took two wagons instead of one. I can\rquote 
t see what difference it makes when the sheep are going to kill they can\rquote t spread any diseases when they are dead.
\par 
\par Thursday
\par Still al clear, no news is good news. The sale at Longtown ran a lot smoother today and sheep were a good trade. Things are starting to look better. 
\par I went to Siloth to pick up a load of fertiliser. It was a very busy place it means spring is in the air and everybody is looking forward instead of standing still.
\par 
\par Friday
\par Short day at work today, finished early 6pm going to the road haulage association annual livestock dinner dance (the annual cow punchers ball). Seen a lot of faces I hadn\rquote 
t seen for a long time, conversation was good and everyone was in good humour.
\par The chairman of the R.H.A made a speech in which he said there was big changes coming up from \'85\'85. He said they were trying to stop livestock transport altogether, looks like we will have a battle on our hands. What people don\rquote 
t realise is without livestock transport breeding programmes will stop. Some breeds of livestock will disappear. Some rare breeds sheep, cattle, pigs all types travel
 all over the country as part of bug breeding programmes to increase numbers of certain breeds.
\par 
\par Saturday
\par Quiet day today, feeling under the weather a little. It must have been a better night than I thought Laid about most of the day and watched the rugby.
\par I felt better as the day went on good job going for tea tonight. }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 , my boss and Ian a friend from Stirling and our partners went for a bar meal to a country pub owned by }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{

\par The pub was fairly quiet when we went in but by the time we had our meal the pub was very busy. There was a lot of local farmers that were out for a meal as well. It was good to see people having confidence to go out again and enjoy themselves.

\par 
\par Tuesday
\par I think everybody in Cumbria wants to restock their farms this week. The phone just doesn\rquote t stop. The funny thing is Cumbria and Devon were the hardest hit areas despi
te that there is livestock coming from Devon to Cumbria and Vice versa. This to me proves the point about breeding livestock, different breeds and bloodlines you can\rquote t buy the bloodlines in a fifty mile radius. Most mule breeding stock and }{
\fs24\insrsid10180473 S}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 waledale sheep the best bloodlines are bred in Cumbria. So when you farm in Buckingham or Norfolk for example, how can you breed good sheep if you are not allowed to transport them. That\rquote 
s what I was meaning in a previous diary about stopping livestock transport. 
\par 
\par Wednesday
\par Went to Siloth for a load of fertiliser today, it was pouring down. When I got loaded I had to put sheets on the load. I stood there soaking and cold thinking all the hassle in the office is not so bad after all. Got back to the office and the boss wa
s a bit under pressure things very busy so it was back in at the deep end. We spent the next few hours sorting tomorrow\rquote s work and were both out on wagons leading stock into Longtown. 
\par 
\par Thursday
\par 06.00 start this morning off my first load of sheep for Longt
own. When I arrived at Longtown there were 3 DEFRA officials on the gate and one mart staff. The mart worker gave me a form to fill in as to where I was going to cleanse the vehicle. The 3 DEFRA officials were making sure the wheels were disinfected, the 
o
nly thing was it was an automatic wheel wash. When I got to the loading banks there was another three officials and as far as I could see none of them seemed to know what they were meant to be doing. After I was empty I had to go to the wash and have my w
heels washed before I could leave the market. When the wheels had been washed I drove out of the market through the automatic wheel wash? Yet I was allowed to go back to my depot without washing out! What\rquote s the point?
\par If it wasn\rquote t for the auction staff aski
ng whose livestock I was carrying nobody would know. All those officials all over the market but nobody asked me where or whose livestock I had on, I would have thought that might just be important. I could have fetched livestock from anywhere, where is t
here so called tractability.
\par Later on in the afternoon I went back to load a load of sheep. I drove straight into the market, nobody on the gate. There was one MLC official on the loading banks. He never asked whose livestock I was lifting or where it was going. I just can\rquote 
t understand where all the sense in this is apart from jobs for the boys.
\par 
\par Friday
\par Went out for a meal tonight with all the staff from Penrith that I worked with on the contiguous cull-it was good to see them all again after 8 months and catch up on what\rquote 
s been happening. Everybody was in good humour and we had a good laugh. It was so different, everybody was relaxed instead of been tense and sort of aprehensive-2 of the girls are pregnant which shoes there is a future to come out of foot and mouth.

\par Monday
\par  Things look as if they could be a
 bit quieter this week. Despite as the day goes on more farmers are ringing wanting cattle fetched up from the South. Its now about 6 months since the last case of foot and mouth and we are still restocking and will be for a long time. It shows just how m
any animals and farms were taken out due to foot and mouth. It also makes you realise just how much devastation there was in Cumbria.
\par 
\par Tuesday
\par WE had a visit from DEFRA today they want us to help them compile a database of livestock haulers. It seems funny to me that the people who set the standards. We have to follow and make the rules, we have to abide by don\rquote 
t know who has to abide by them. This is all to do with trace ability no wonder things were such a mess. 
\par We had a phone call yesterday from someone 
in DEFRA asking about trace ability. The girl wanted to know how we kept a trace on our movements. We told her everything we moved was in a computer and on delivery notes and by livestock movement sheets. The girl then asked what a livestock movement shee
t
 was and could we fax one to her so she could see what they looked like. Between DEFRA not knowing who is carrying livestock and not knowing now or what records are kept. Its easy to see why the foot and mouth crisis was such a mess. Its amazing a year on
 they are finally consulting people that count, its such a pity they didn\rquote t think of doing that a year ago things might have been a lot different. But I suppose that\rquote s something we will never know.
\par 
\par Wednesday
\par Things are getting busier as the week goes on; n
early all of the abattoirs are looking for sheep the demand is getting better. The public confidence in eating meat again is growing also the export of meat is quietly growing again. The price of live animals is quite good which makes things look good. Th
ere is starting to get a bit of atmosphere in the farming community again which is a good sign of things getting better.
\par 
\par Thursday 
\par I took a load of sheep into Longtown this morning, there were more officials than last week, I\rquote ve never seen so many in one place. I don\rquote 
t know whether it was right or not but one of the auction staff told me one of the auctioneers had fell out with the head vet. The upshot of them falling out was more officials to make sure everything was done the way they wanted. In my mind th
ey went too far some farmers and buyers fell out with them as well basically because they went too far. At the end of the day we are all here to work together and common sense will always prevail so why upset people and push them to the limit when there i
s no need.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Friday
\par We are preparing the work for the weekend because my boss is going away for the weekend and as usual when he is away it looks as if it is going to be busy.
\par One of our drivers phoned in this afternoon he had a load of fertiliser on for local farm but when he phoned the farm to say he was coming the farmer told him he wouldn\rquote 
t be there to lift it off. The farmer told him if he left the tractor out he could lift it off himself so he phoned to see if someone could go and help him. I went to 
the farm with the driver to drive the tractor for him. While I was lifting the fertilizer I was thinking 12 months ago we wouldn\rquote 
t be allowed near the farm let alone in the farm driving his tractor, it shows how things can change so much in a short space of time.
\par 
\par Saturday
\par  Went into work at 9.00, supposedly for one hour just to sort out men and wagons for Sunday and Monday. I gave up at 18.30 and still had some of Mondays work still to sort out. There is 4 wagons going int
o Scotland in the morning they are picking sheep up off 18 different farms from Forfar to Gretna. I don\rquote 
t think DEFRA realise that at this time of year when fat lambs are getting less but demand is still there the distance that has to covered to make up numbers to keep up with demand.
\par 
\par Sunday
\par The phone started ringing at 03.30 one of the wagons going to load wouldn\rquote t start so I got up and went and helped put another wagon ready to get him away. Went back to bed at 03.45. The phone rang again at 08.15 one of
 the drivers had got to his first farm to find nobody there, no sheep and no way he could get in with the size of vehicle he had. I got up and went to work and phoned the auctioneer who had bought the sheep so he went and sorted it out.  I went back home 
a
nd had some breakfast. About 12.30 the first wagon phoned it loaded and the others all phoned within half an hour. I went to work and phoned drivers who were going with wagons to come in. I printed their delivery notes. Once the wagons were in and gone ag
ain I went home. 
\par Another drivers\rquote  wife phoned at 22.30 she had taken her husband to hospital with pains so he wouldn\rquote t be at work in the morning. Looks like another early start in the morning.

\par I seen a lot of faces that I hadn\rquote t seen for over a 
year there was a lot of handshaking and catching up. It was good to see everybody again. The one thing I noticed with not seeing people for so long how much people had changed i.e. aged and put weight on. 
\par 
\par Tuesday
\par We had a visit from an auditor he wanted 
to see all our accounts for work done for DEFRA. He is looking through everything because he has to make sure there was no wastage because the money to pay for foot and mouth is coming from Europe. He was asking why there was so many people and vehicles w
orking and why after the job was done did it take so long to do the paperwork and finish off. It didn\rquote t take a lot of explaining, \'93DEFRA\'94.
\par 
\par Wednesday
\par Quiet day today spent most of the day catching up on paperwork and filing. We were trying to catch up on so
me of the men who worked for us when we were doing the cull for DEFA. I ratched out some of my books with lists of people who were employed or who had their names forward for employment. Looking at the books there was a big list of names. It was surprisin
g how many people offered to help not just because of the money but because they wanted to help. In the height of the cull we had approx 200 people employed and about 98% of them were local people.
\par Thursday
\par DEFRA phoned today asking for the same information I sent them a few weeks ago, it seems to me they either don\rquote 
t care and just leave things lying around and it gets lost or they think people are trying to hide something from them. Nobody has anything to gain from hiding anything from them so it must be they don\rquote t care.
\par 
\par Friday
\par The boss is away for the weekend today so I\rquote m left with everything again. I am trying to get all the weekends work done today as it is my Fathers retirement party tonight. He is actually 66 but because a lot of family and friends are
 connected to farming we had to postpone it last year . The party starts at 19.30 I was hoping to be there on time to see his face as he knew nothing about it. But I didn\rquote 
t get finished until 20.00. Everybody was already there when I got there and I missed the first half an hour I was there because my phone wouldn\rquote 
t stop ringing. When the phone stopped ringing and I went back I enjoyed what was left of the night. I saw a lot of Aunties and Uncles I hadn\rquote t seen for a long time because of foot and mouth then 
being busy after foot and mouth. We had a good laugh and some good conversations. It was all the better because F&M was never mentioned everybody was in good spirit. A lot of the time I am a bit apprehensive about going out because people keep asking me w
hat was it like, what did you see, I just get a bit sick of talking about it all the time.
\par 
\par Saturday
\par Spent nearly all day phoning farmers all over Scotland to arrange to pick their sheep up tomorrow as I didn\rquote t get it all done yesterday. Spent quite a while
 trying to get drivers for the wagons as well a lot of our part time drivers are farmers or farmers sons so with them restocking and weather being good they are all at home. Six or eight months ago it wasn\rquote 
t a problem because none of these men had anything at home to work with. Most of these men wanted to work then basically to make a wage and to get them out of the house away from bad memories. 
\par 
\par Sunday
\par Had a lie in this morning the phone didn\rquote t ring until 09.30 it was great.  Only in work for about 4 hour
s so I got some time to relax and spend time with my wife and son. The only thing was after I took my son home I had to go back into work for a couple of hours and sort out Mondays work. I finally got home about 9pm never mind one more week at work then I

\par 
\par Wednesday
\par Out in a wagon today I went to Ancroft, Codingham, Cockburnspath, Duns, Greenlaw and Hawick to collect sheep. All the sheep I collected were what they call self-declaration which means the farmer fills a form in. On the form they have to put
 their name and address, their holding number and the number of sheep and where they were going. On the form there is a Collum the driver has to fill in the name of a hauler and registration number.
\par This is supposed to be DEFRA\rquote s way of tracing the animals back to origin. The farmer doesn\rquote 
t have to put ear numbers on the form so they could put any sheep on the wagon and the driver would know no differently. So to me all the hassle of forms and different pick up points is a waste of time, there is no trace ability.
\par 
\par Thursday
\par  In the office today, a live sale in Longtown.  Longtown was quiet today not a lot of livestock in today. We found out that last week there was an argument with the head vet and some of the buyers. The auctioneers had found out that there
 was going to be an invasion of head DEFRA officials on Longtown so they got most of their customers and buyers to take their sheep to Dumfries on Wednesday. They were right, there was more officials than people and livestock put together. What are they t
r
ying to prove or are they just being awkward to keep themselves in a job. Why do they pick on Longtown could it be that it was the first market to be confirmed and was at the centre of foot and mouth or could it be it was one of the biggest and most succe
ssful in Europe they want to make it a Scapegoat to convince Europe of something.

\par

\par

\par Thursday
\par 
\par I was leading sheep into Longtown this morning. If you are not washing the vehicles out at the market you have to fill out: where the vehicle is k
ept, reg number, type of vehicle and the drivers name and address. I filled the form out as Mickey Mouse, Disney World, Florida handed it in and drove out of the market. How are they going to trace that vehicle? It just proves the system they have in plac
e is a waste of time and the people implementing it don'\rquote  know what they are doing.
\par I still can\rquote t get hold of a vet in Copenhagen I phoned two people who we have taken pigs to Lithuania before but they couldn\rquote t help me much either. I am starting to panic a little now because if he gets to Copenhagen and can\rquote 
t get a vet the captain of the ship might not let him sail.

\par Friday
\par 
\par The route plan for Italy has been passed all I need to do is get some Euros for the road Tolls in Italy. The pig company phoned me today they want a load of pigs taken to Greece a week on Monday. I tried to book Ferr}{\fs24\insrsid10180473 ie}{

n holiday rather than flying. I have left it with the travel company we use sometimes to try and get me a ferry. I phoned DEFRA at page street in London to see if they could help me contact a vet in Copenhagen. They had no contact numbers and the ministry
 vet couldn\rquote 
t help me much. What he did tell me that because the deer will vetted and blood tested before they go on the wagon he will already have stamped papers. He faxed me a letter for the driver to take with him to say that DEFRA had approved the movem
ent of deer and a direct contact number for him. So somebody from Copenhagen could phone him if they had any doubt. Not that he could do much in England when the wagon would be in Copenhagen, but at least he was trying to help.

 in Copenhagen to let them know the deer would be there Tuesday night for Wednesday morning and they would need to be vetted.  But they weren't very helpful either. I don't know what more I can do apart from cross my fingers.
\par Still trying to get a ferry from Italy to Greece. I think I might have a crossing from Bari to Brindisi, it's not what I wanted as it means a 12-14 hour journey across Greece. I will have to work out a route plan for the journey now.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid484382 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  went to get his ferry this morning. When he went into the office for his ticket he told the team he needed a vet. The man took him to the door and pointed to a door across the road way. }{
\fs24\insrsid484382 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  went across, knocked on the door and the vet came.  The vet asked him if his deer were all right and if he checked them.  }{\fs24\insrsid484382 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  told him he's
 been feeding them regularly for the last two days and that he had just fed them again and they were fine.  The vet stamped his papers and went. He didn't even look at the animals.  All that hassle for nothing, I needn't have bothered.
\par I managed to change 
the ferry for Greece so drew up a route plan and sent it to Cotswold for them to get it approved by DEFRA.  Just before I finished tonight I got a phone call from Cotswold saying DEFRA had rejected the route plan, they say the vehicle could go another 3 h
ours before needing to stop for the rest period.
\par 
\par Thursday I made a new route plan for Italy with a stop 3 hours further into Italy than before and faxed it to Cotswold. By tea-time it was back rejected again. DEFRA saying it was now too far.
\par I asked }{\fs24\insrsid484382 G}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  about it and asked him what I could do. }{\fs24\insrsid484382 G}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 is one of the bosses and he used to do all the continental work but he runs a depot in Carlisle now so the continental work was passed to me.  I told him I didn't want to do it as it wasn't worth the hassle. I also tol
d him I didn't know enough about the continent to do it and it was taking up too much of my time so other jobs were getting neglected . He told me I would have to do it as there was nobody else so I told him and the rest of them if I had to carry on doing
 the continent, once this Greece load was done I would resign.  There was no reply, whether they thought I was just saying that in the heat of the moment I don't think they thought I was serious.
\par 
\par Fri
\par I sent Cotswold another route plan with a destination between the two points I had previously put forward and faxed it to them to put to DEFRA. Low and behold it came back again.  DEFRA say it is too far again so I done another and sent it to them  T}{

Cotswold phoned me, he had spoken to somebody in Page street and they told him if we put Bari on the route plan they would pass it.  I was so annoyed at this. Why couldn't they say that in the first place. The thing that annoyed me most was it is impossib
le to make Brindisi in one shift but they passed it yet all the places we had put on the route plans that could have been reached they rejected.  So that was basically a week's work wasted because of some idiot with a bit of power.
\par }{\fs24\insrsid484382 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  arrived at his destinat

  My boss was working outside this morning. It was raining heavily and his pocket in his waterproof jacket filled with water and drowned his phone so I had the phones. He was going out for tea this afternoon so he asked me if I would go to Lockerbie and l

\par I got caught up this morning so I was delivering fertiliser this afternoon for a couple of hours. It was great to be out of the office for a while. No hassle, a bit of crack with the farmers. It was good driving round the country
side seeing the lambs in the fields skipping about and the odd field of cattle.  It looks so much better than it did this time last year, clear skies, life in the fields instead of dead animals and black smoke everywhere.

\fs24\insrsid13964281 's Mam and Dad. The lambing is going pretty well. They only have about 35 left to lamb out of 150. It's so nice here, no noise, n

\par I went with A}{\fs24\insrsid484382  }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 today delivering eggs and potatoes to the different villages round Islay.
 I seen a few people I hadn't seen for a while and caught up on gossip of what has been happening.  It's funny even a year on people are still asking what it was like living in Longtown and all the F&M roundabout me.  They want to know because they only s

n I helped him with a fence at the house.  We put a mesh on it like a screen to stop some of the wind getting into the garden. The wind over here can be savage and with it coming off the sea it turns the plants in the garden black with the salt.  I went f
o
r a walk with the rifle this afternoon. Their neighbour is overrun with rabbits so she asked if I would go over a shoot a few. I got 4 but best of all was the peace.  Out on the shore on my own, it was so peaceful.  All you could hear was the sea and the 
gulls.  I was late back for my tea, I just lost track of time being there in the peace and quiet, nobody to bother me and no hassle, it was great.

\par Came home from Islay today. }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  is a bit upset, she misses country life. The livestock and the freedom.  The think she misses most is looking out of the window either over the Atlantic or out over 
the fields.  She says all you see out of our windows is other people's houses.  She also misses the animals just being able to walk out of the door and they are there.
\par 
\par Tuesday Back to reality today with a bang.  The wagon that went to Greece has had probl
ems. When travelling with livestock you are allowed to travel 24 hours then yu have to stop for 24 hours and rest the animals. In that 24 hours you are supposed to unload the animals, rest them load them again and continue your journey.  There is a provis
i
on in them rules which says with pedigree livestock, as long as there is adequate food and water on the vehicle and the animals have room to lie down, the 24 hour rest period can be spent on the vehicle.  The latter being written in the WATO (Welfare of A
nimals Transport order) in Britain but not in the European version of the WATO rules.
\par 
\par The drivers had stopped at a Truck stop about 4 hours off Bari in Italy, they had fed and watered the pigs, bedded them down and filled the water tanks and were taking th
eir 24 hour rest.  They had been there about 6 hours when they were knocked up out of their beds by an Italian vet and the police.  The vet told them that they were breaking the law, he said they should be at a proper staging post with lairage facilities.
 
 They showed him the route which DEFRA had passed and they also showed him the health and pedigree certificates for the pigs.  They explained that the pigs were hybrids and full pedigree so it wasn't really safe to take them off where there was other anim
a
ls and also explained about the 24 hours been taken on the vehicle because the pigs had adequate food and water and were all lying quite peaceful.  The Italian vet still wasn't happy, he was reading the WATO rules by the letter. Consequently he took them 
to an abattoir that had been closed for 3-4 years, made them take the pigs off for 245 hours and fined them 3000 Euros.
\par 
\par When you are in a foreign country you don't stand much chance. They don't seem to care about the health of animals as much as we do.  Th
e abattoir they took them to used to kill horses - Sadam Insane - and was left in the state it was the day sanctions were fetched in.  All we can do is hope the pigs haven't picked up a disease.
\par 
\par Weds
\par I've got to the state where I am losing interest in my 
job and the livestock haulage industry. When you used to go into a market there was a buzz about the place but now there isn't half as many people go to markets so there isn't the same atmosphere.  Also when you went to the market, you had a good crack, a
 
good laugh with lads from other haulage firms but now everyone is sick with rules and regulations.  Also when you were loading in a market, everybody used to muck in and help each other but now everybody is working against the clock and they just get on, 
look after themselves and go.  The fun has gone out of the job.
\par 
\par Thursday
\par Early start again this morning. I was leading sheep into Longtown for the sale today.  The market was quite busy this morning, there was a lot of stock in.  Things seem to be getting 
back to something like normality apart from all the yellow jackets still walking about.
\par I was moving cattle out to grass today which is a good sign of summer coming. It is god to see the animals back out in the fields.  AS the restocking is still ongoing it is starting to show by the number of fields that have livestock in them.
\par 
\par Fri
\par Boss away for the week-end again he is away on a golf week-end.  Things are fairly quiet and not just as busy so hopefully I will have a quiet week-end.  The phone rang at 11.3
0 pm, it was my boss. Fishers cattle had burst a wall and got out on the road and could I go and help get them back in. That's a good start to a quiet week-end.
\par 
\par Sat
\par There was a sale of pedigree livestock at Carlisle today, there was about 200 bulls for sa
le.  I had one wagon there just in case any of our customers were there.  One or two had phoned to say that they were going to the sale but it would depend on the price of the animals.  The customers our lad went to see decided by lunchtime that things we
r
e too expensive to buy and he went home.  Just an hour after he left the phone rang, it was somebody looking for transport for 1 bull to Aberdeen, then half an hour after that it was somebody looking for transport for 1 bull to South Wales.  The rules are
 
you have to register to buy in the market and also tell the market who is  doing your haulage because the livestock has to be out of the market by 10pm the same night.  You would think people knowing what the rules are would have arranged their transport.
 Also the market if they had checked their forms to see if they had made arrangements and if not they could suggest somebody instead of waiting till they had bought livestock.
\par 
\par It makes it hard work for everybody especially the markets because if the livest
ock isn't moved the market can't have a sale next day. This has happened on a few occasions at Carlisle lately. You would think they would have learned and started to check for things like that.
\par 
\par Sun
\par The phones are quiet today and there is only one wagon out today so I have time to spend with }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
.  The weather is quite good today so we went for a run, the only problem is we can't go too far because I'm on duty is anything goes wrong I need to go to work. I can't be too far away.
\par I only need to go into work for 10 minutes tonight to put 1 DLY note out once I get the final numbers of the load.

\par The Boss is back this morning as per usual, no thanks for holding the fort for the
 week-end. Just a swearing because I didn't fill in the running book yesterday.  I think he was just tired because there was only 1 wagon out.  He said if anything happened nobody else would know what was going out.  I told him if anything happened I was 
t
he one on call and nobody else would bother their backside so what difference did it make. That just made it worse so I just shut up and went outside for ten minutes.  When I went back in I just got on with my DLY notes off the Tippers and he was alright 
after that.
\par 
\par Tuesday 
\par Things were a bit better today. }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 told me the new Portakabin in the yard was for us because the company had expanded in so many different areas, office space was getting scarce.  Because the livestock is a department that is individual
 from the rest we are the only ones that can really move out. I don't think it will work but time will tell.
\par We lifted the \tab Portakabin into place this afternoon.  It looks like we will be moving in sooner than I thought we would.
\par 
\par Weds
\par We found out today t
hat DEFRA are going to allow live sales of store sheep in the markets.  That was good news until we found out that all sales of sheep store or fat would be classed as store sales and the livestock would have to be licensed into the market and out again.  
I
 can see the point in licensing store sheep because they are coming off one farm going through a market then probably onto another farm so that they can trace their movement.  I can't understand why they want to license fat sheep because once they leave t
he market they go directly to the abattoir where they have to be killed within 48 hours.  I can't see the point of license when the animals are going to get killed, they won't spread any disease then.
\par 
\par Thursday Early start again this morning, sheep to lead 
into Longtown.  I don't mind working but I am supposed to be a Transport manager. How I am supposed to keep up with what's going on and where the wagon and drivers are when I'm getting sent out all the time.  The way livestock haulage is drivers don't wan
t
 to do the job now, they don't want  the dirt and hassle.  Drivers now can drive a curtain sider, be parked up at  a decent time of night and keep clean and get paid as much so it's no wonder nobody wants to drive a livestock wagon.  One of the biggest th
i
ngs is the rules and regulations involved in livestock transport.  Because of the way things are in road haulage everybody is short of drivers so that is one of the reasons I have to drive as much as I do.  The only thing is I'm driving more and more and 
I
'm getting a bit sick of it. I like driving but I'm supposed to be a manager not a driver. If I wanted to be a driver all my life I wouldn't have accepted a job in the office.  The other thing with me being on a salary I don't get extra for starting early
 or working week-ends and it's happening more and more. I'm getting to the stage of getting out and doing something else.
\par 
\par Fri
\par Me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 were thinking about selling the house we have got and moving. We have been thinking of it for a while and then we thought if we sell the house we have got we might be able to build a house on the island where }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{
\fs24\insrsid13964281 's parents are.  We mentioned this to }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
's Mam and Dad and they said why not build on their croft. If they gave us a piece of ground we just have to build the house.  This sounded good to me, it could just be the change I need.  We sent away for prices of kit houses to see how much it would 
cost and whether we could afford it or not.  Fingers crossed we will be able to afford to do it.

\par Some of the brochures arrived this morning and at a first glance it looks as if we will be able to build a house.  The only thing is it depends on now is
 how much our own house is worth.  We have decided to pant our house and tidy it up and get it valued to give us an idea of how much it is worth. We have also decided to look into building a house on Islay properly to see what it will entail.
\par It was Mam's birthday today so me and my two brothers and their kids surprised her by taking her out for a meal tonight.  Mam enjoyed her night apart from my son }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281

\par I wasn't really looking forward to seeing a b

\par Tired this morning but just got on with what I had to do.  The livestock is quieting down, the abattoirs have stopped killing hogs and started killing lambs so we will be quiet for a week or two because there isn't a lot of lambs in Cumbria this year.

\par I done all my tipper notes this morning. I was so engrossed it was dinner time before I realised.
\par }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was in a meting this afternoon so when the cat's away the mice will play.  I had a look on the internet at houses to give me a bit of an idea of what would be go
od to build.  I ordered some more brochures so we had a good scope of what is available.
\par Tuesday We found out today that DEFRA has revoked the licence allowing markets to have live store sales. We couldn't find out why DEFRA won't give anybody a reason why
.  The first live sale is supposed to be on Friday. There is sheep booked for the first sales. The markets and ourselves have to contact the customers to tell them we are not allowed to pick their sheep up to take them to market.  There was a lot of upset
 people especially when we couldn't give them an explanation why.  DEFRA are good at letting people down then leaving other people to do the explaining and picking up the pieces.
\par We tried all afternoon to get an explanation of DEFRA why they revoked the licence but we would have been as well talking to the sheep we carry.
\par 
\par Weds
\par Still no explanation this morning but we find out that they might grant the licence now.  The sales have already been cancelled so there will be no store sale this week,  We think the
y are playing their usual fame of stalling things for a while. They don't seem to care who they upset along the way. For a supposedly free country we are all being controlled in a way by people who have been given a bit of power which has gone to their he
ads.  About 40 or 50% of this country is involved or linked to the livestock industry, possibly more.  At the moment all of these people are being told how to run their business and what they can or can't do. Is this a free country?  
\par The furniture arrived for the Portakabin today. }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 's hoping to be moved by this time next week. The steps up to it are nearly built so it looks like we could be.
\par 
\par Thursday Early start again even earlier this morning. The sheep are getting further away.  I had to start at 05.00 am today to get the sheep to the market early enough because of the restrictions. Because there isn\rquote 
t a lot of sheep in Cumbria yet, local markets are having to canvas further away to keep numbers up in their sales. After this week it shouldn't be as bad because of the abattoirs not wanting hoggs.
\par I couldn't understand why when we are as quiet as we are I had to go for the sheep this morning as we have plenty of drivers. The only thing I could think of is because I am on a salary it wasn't costing them wages
 for me, to go for them. It would be a waste of time saying anything because my boss would just make up an excuse.  All this is just making it easier for me to make the decision to build a house on Islay.
\par 
\par Fri
\par Tensions are running a bit high at work becaus
e of diversification and wages. Because the company has grown by at least a third in the year, more wagons, more staff but no more room.  The mechanics haven't got enough room in the garage, we haven't got enough room in the office, the warehouse isn't bi
g enough, the yard is too small and the wages are the same way.  The wage offer this year was an insult. It's alright expanding but if you don't keep the staff up to date as well you are wasting your time. As a result, tensions are high.
\par I fell out with one of the mechanics today over one of the vans because he wanted to wash their van and use one of the others. It was a bit petty really, it was just because of the way things are.
\par 
\par Sat
\par I started cleaning the yard and doing some repairs today.  I didn't get much done in the morning because }{\fs24\insrsid484382 [friends were]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 in to see us so I didn't get a lot done.  I got on better this afternoon, It was quite good. I could work at my own pace not telephones and no hassle. There is quite a bit to do because I got nothing done last
 year because things were so busy. I want to get everything painted and tidies up so I can get everything valued to see what it will cost to build or if it is feasible.
\par 
\par Sun
\par Me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  and a few of the lads from work went for a game of golf this morning.
  We went to Langholm where the golf course is up the hill overlooking the town.  The view off the top is really nice and I enjoyed my game.  I haven't played for over a year and played quite well which made it good.

\par Mon
\par Busy today, paperwork of the Tippers to do but the livestock side is quiet. It's just the time of year between the hogs finishing and the lambs starting. When I got home tonight with it being quite early, I had tea and started fixing another garage door. 
}{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was out as well stripping paint off another door. We didn't stop until dark so things are taking shape now.
\par 
\par Tuesday Things are getting better at work. They have come with a better pay offer, the only thing is those of us on salary haven't had an off
er yet.  All the lads are a lot happier though so moods are a lot better. It was raining when I got home tonight so I couldn't do any work in the yard.
\par 
\par Weds
\par }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  is away today it's the Iveco Golf Day so I am in the office on the livestock side on my own.  Although the livestock isn't very busy when you are on your own, there is plenty to do.
\par A fax came from DEFRA today, they are doing an investigation into what people have been paid and now want all the invoices, all the vehicle reg nos, who owns them, fleet 
nos and the hours they have worked. It will take 3 2 or 3 weeks to sort that out. They already have all this info 10 times over but now they want it all on hard disc.  I will have to check everything we done against the invoices, put it all together, then
 
put it on one disc. All the work is on one disc and all the invoicing is on another disc.  I think that because there is so many Inquiries going on, they are looking for mistakes so they can portion the blame on other people.  I couldn't do anything with 
it today because I was too busy and I won't get a chance tomorrow because }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  is away again.
\par 
\par Thursday 
\par There was a live sale of cows and calves and breeding heifers at Carlisle today. It was the biggest sale of breeding stock yet. }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was away again so it was 
left tome again. Things were quite busy  and two of the lads that work in the yard were off so there was a lot to do.  It was 9pm before I went to Carlisle. I had two wagons to load and it was 12.30 am before I came away.  There was no DEFRA people left a
nd nobody to disinfect the wheels on the way out.
\par Throughout the day when DEFRA are there the rules are strict but when they've decided to go home it's a free for all. How can they monitor the job correctly from home?  It makes you think more and more they are just keeping themselves in a job.

\par It's }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
's Gran's birthday tomorrow so we went to Kilmarnock tonight. Her Gran is 77 this year. I was finished at reasonable time tonight - 18.45 so we just got ready and set off.  The weather going up was terr
ible, really heavy rain. I was tired from the night before but I was worse by the time we got there.
\par 
\par Sat
\par We went out for lunch today with }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 's Gran and Papa, we went to a hotel near Troon where they go every week.  I met a lot of their friends who ask
ed where I was from and what I done for a living.  I had a good conversation with 1 or 2 of them and for a change F&M was never mentioned. It was good they talked about holidays and their families and I enjoyed the conversation (no doom and glom).
\par We called in at a garden centre on the way back. Papa wanted some bedding plants.  When we got back, }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 's sister was there to surprise her Gran.
\par Some more of Gran's neighbours and friends came round in the evening for a couple of hours. Conversation was quite good again. We talked about all sorts of things except Foot and Mouth. I felt totally relaxed today and just enjoyed doing very little.

\par Papa got himself a fresh car last week and asked if I would change the oil fro him as he can't get up and down of
 his knees very easily. I like tinkering about with cars and machinery so it was quite good fun.  I done a few other little jobs on the car as well.  The weather was nice and some of papa's neighbours were out in the garden so papa was back and forward ta
lking to them. I would say Papa enjoyed himself as much as I did.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 Usual Monday paperwork for the Tippers to do so I was busy this morning.  It was lunch time before I realised.  I got my paperwork finished about teatime and started on the paperwork for DEFRA.
\par Mam and Dad came tonight and I was outside trying to get the g
arage doors finished.  Dad helped me so we just got on and I finished them.  It was 22.30 when we finished.  I was pleased because they are ready to paint now.  I told Dad tonight about moving to Islay and building a house.  He said I had to think about t
he future but I think he was a bit apprehensive because I have a good job here.  I might have a good job but it's getting worse and what will it be like in 10 years the way regulations are going?
\par 
\par Tuesday 
\par We still haven't got moved into our new office yet, we are waiting for the telephone to be fitted.  I started going through the invoices and paperwork for DEFRA.  As I didn't need my computer today and we are short of space in the office so }{
\i\fs24\insrsid13964281  }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 went into the portakabin to let somebody else use my computer. It
 was so quiet in there, no telephones but I got a lot of work done.  I was pleased to get home tonight. I'm just pissed off with DEFRA - why can't they just let it drop. As far as I am concerned it's over, let's get on with it and forget the past.
\par 
\par Weds
\par Wh
en I went  to bed last night I wasn't feeling too well. I woke up about midnight and was sick and had a bad stomach.  When I got up I still wasn't feeling too good but like a silly bugger I went to work because I wanted to finish the work for DEFRA.  When
 I got to work }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 sent me to 2 farms near Dumfries, then into Dumfries mart. AS the morning went on I felt worse, bad stomach and really weary.  I got back about 13.30 and went home.  Normally I would have suffered and stopped at work and carried on. But the
 way I feel at the moment I've lost a lot of interest in the job and also I'm coming up to 40 next year. It's time I started looking after myself rather than putting work first and me second.
\par I went home, put the fire on and fell asleep on the floor in front of the fire.  I woke up not long before }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  came home from work and I felt a lot better.  Me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{
\fs24\insrsid13964281  painted one of the garages but when we had got one done I felt I had done enough so we will see what tomorrow brings.
\par Thursday Back to work this m
orning. Still don't feel right but I feel a lot better than I did.  I spent a lot of the day going through checking all the work we done for DEFRA.  It's strange when you see something written down, how you remember other things that are not written down 
t
hat happened that day.  At the time it seemed like an eternity but when you see it all in a few boxes of files and go through them, there was a lot of work done in a short space of time.  Some of the people in Defra's auditors are questioning the hours th
a
t have been worked i.e. 12-18 hours a day. What they don't realise is that 14 or 15 hours is a normal day in the livestock industry. A farmer gets up to milk at 5 or 6 am and by the time he milks and feeds up in an evening it can be 7 or 8 pm.  It is the 
same with us. We can start at 5 am leading into a market and if it is a big sale it can be early hours of the next morning before you are finished.
\par 
\par Friday
\par Wind down for the week-end.  Spent half a day on DEFRA and the other half preparing for the week-end Bank Holiday Monday and Tuesday so if I get everything done I might get 2 days off.
\par }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  came to stay tonight and  I look forward to him coming to stay because I miss him when he's not here.  When he's been here for a week or more it's good but when he go
es home I get up in a morning and I am looking for him.
\par 
\par Sat
\par The weather was quite good today so it was back to  repairs and paint. The place is starting to look tidy now and I got most of the repairs done today and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  got most of the undercoating done
.  I am going for a game of golf in the morning so I won't get much done tomorrow.

\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 got a little bored so far round so I gave him one of my golf clubs and a ball and he was knocking the ball around while we were playing. The boredom stopped, then he was getting quite good towards the end.  I have my old clubs 
so I told him if he was interested I would get my old clubs out for him.
\par I set the video for the England game before we went out so when we came back }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  and Brian came in and watched the match with us.  So that was all that was done today. By the time they

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 Mon  Off work today and  the weather was good in the afternoon.  Me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 cleaned my garage out (or started to). We filled the van full of rubbish in the morning and took it away to the tip.  In the afternoon I was doing one or two little repairs finishing off and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 wanted to help me, then he wanted to make something.  He wanted to make some ladders like mine so I got him some old bits of wood and some nails and he made his ladder.  I told him the lad
der wouldn't take his weight because it was made of old off cuts.  He wouldn't listen and had to try it but surprisingly it held him.
\par 
\par Tues  }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was at work today but I was off. The weather was quite good so I was outside working and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was out with 
me.  I was putting new spouts on the garages when }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 appeared with his ladder.  He went up and down it twice then it broke.  He was quite upset but the look on his face I couldn't help but laugh.  I got some better timber off the loft and we made a new 
one together.  He was happy now he had made a ladder about f foot high and strong enough to take my weight as well because I had to try it before he would climb it.
\par It was nearly dark before I stopped tonight but everything is just to gloss now and all we need now is a couple of days of decent weather.
\par 
\par Weds  Back to work unfortunately but never mind only three days unto the week-end.  That sounds bad in a way it's like wishing your life away.
\par The telephone engineers arrived today to put the telephones in the new office at long last. It looks as if we could be moving in.  The moving came quicker than I thought, they switched the phones over about 4pm and }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{
\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 announced we would have to move now.  He disappeared in a wagon and left it to me.  I had all the papers to take upstairs, about 10 boxes full and then empty my desk and move it upstairs because somebody was waiting to get my desk.  I was a bit pissed of
f because by the time I had got everything moved the new office was a mess because I just had to dump everything.  I had everything moved when }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 came back.  He told me that I would need to start at 05.00 in the morning to lead sheep into Longtown. I could have cracked him one but I just went home instead - after all it was 7pm.
\par 
\par Thurs  It work at 05.00 - it looked like it was going to be a good day, the sun was out then.  I got to the farm at 06.00. It was quite nice the sun was out and the birds were singing, could this be summer?
\par It was about 08.00 when I got back into Longtown with the sheep, }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 must have been feeling guilty because when I was empty my phone rang and he told me to come into the canteen for breakfast.  I walked straight into the canteen. }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  h
ad ordered my breakfast and paid for it (he must have been feeling guilty). I turned round, went back out and washed my hands.  What I want to know is where was DEFRA?  I shouldn't have been able to get anywhere near the canteen without washing my hands a
nd dipping my feet. They made the rules when are they to police them?
\par I spent the rest of the day trying to tidy the office and put things away in between other jobs.  About 6.30 pm I was ready for coming home when }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  asked if I would help him load a wagon. 
 I thought at the time the breakfast was too good to be true but you can't help but like the shit house.  We loaded the wagon so it was 8.15pm when I got finished.
\par Fri  }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  is away again today yet another golfing day so I just worked away slowly this morning
 putting the files in cupboards.  I had a long lunch break today and watched the England game.  I put all my stuff in my new desk this afternoon and went home at 6pm.  Mam and Dad were in the house when I got home and Dad said if it was food weather he wo
uld come and help us paint in the morning.  Fingers crossed it will be good.
\par They had just gone when my phone rang and I had to go back to work so it was 8.30 pm before I got finished.  The quiet time of year and I am working more hours now that I do when it is busy.
\par 
\par Sat When I got up this morning the weather was good so nipped to Carlisle for some more paint.  When I got back Dad was there so we just got started.  By lunch time we had 3 sets of garage doors glossed, just one set of doors, the coal shed and
 the upstairs of the garages to do.  While we were having lunch the heavens opened and it looked like it was in for the afternoon.  We waited a little while but it was nothing like stopping so we gave up and Dad went home.
\par Me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  were wondering what to do so we emptied the living room and painted that. By the time we got that done and tidied up and everything back in place it was 11.30pm and time for bed.
\par 
\par Sun  Today which isn't like me I didn't get up until 11.00, but it was just as well as it was still wet.  }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 was still in bed so I washed the kitchen floor while waiting to see if it would dry up. It was still raining when I finished so I went into my garage to sort everything out on the shelves and the work bench.
\par }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  got up and decided because it was wet she might as well empty our bedroom and start to decorate it (we must be gluttons for punishment).  We had our tea about 6pm and the sun was out.  So }{
\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  went and put another coat of emulsion on the bedroom while I went outside and starte
d to paint the upstairs of the garages.  I got so engrossed it was dark before I stopped. It's looking good now thought - half a day and I will have it finished.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 Mon  Back to the grind - usual Monday all the delivery notes for the tippers last w
eek.  I have to write all their work onto a job sheet, then input it all into the computer. Then I have to fax the sheets away so the jobs can be priced - then photocopy all the notes. There is three tippers which can do two or three loads a day and there
 can be between two and five notes for each load.  So as you can understand it takes me most of the day on a Monday to so all that.  It was worse today because me and }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 are sharing a computer at the moment because they have only got one programme in. 
\par Me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 nipped to Brampton at dinner time to get a new carpet for the bedroom because we decided the old one was knackered.  By the time we get the house and garages finished we won't want to sell it because it will look that good.
\par 
\par Tues  Things are not v
ery busy at work so I took the opportunity and finished checking everything for DEFRA so I could get it finished and out of the way. It took me nearly all day but I am so pleased I have got it finished. I just hope they don't come back looking for more.

\par When I got home from work I had my tea and while }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 was painting the walls in the bedroom I was repairing some floor boards I wasn't happy with.  We worked until midnight because we want the room finished because they are coming to fit the carpet on Friday.
\par 
\par Weds  Things are still quiet at work today so we set about and got the office sorted and into some sort of shape so we can work without working in a mess.  My computer was programmed in today so I can get caught up now.  I spent the afternoon catching
 up, it's good because we're not sharing one computer now I can get on with my work anytime now without waiting for }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  to finish.
\par After I had my tea tonight me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  glossed the skirting boards and window in the bedroom so everything should be dry for them fitting the carpet.  Me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{
\fs24\insrsid13964281  fell out about 11.30pm. I was trying to put the curtain rail up after }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 had cleaned it but I got a bit of paint on it. The only reason we fell out was because we were both tired - we've been doing too much I would say.
\par 
\par Thurs  No sheep to fetch into Longtown so I didn't have to start early this morning. With things being quiet we have a TV in the office for the World Cup so there hasn't been a lot getting done in the morning.
\par I took some sheep to Penrith after lu
nch then came back into Carlisle in case there were any cows and calves to take out.  I walked straight up through Carlisle Mart No problem - it was if nothing had ever happened. On the other hand they said in Longtown this morning the DEFRA official was 
playing war with everyone for not zipping their jackets on, I didn't even have a jacket on at Carlisle.  It's time somebody set a standard set of rules and then pass them on to these idiots so everybody knows what they have to do.
\par I got a phone call while  I was at Carlisle, it was the people we are buying the carpet off.  The warehouse where they get the carpets off had phoned them when they rolled the carpet out to cut ours off they found a flaw in it so they can't fit ours until
 Tuesday now. I was a bit peeved after working late all week to get the room ready but there is nothing we can do except wait until Tuesday.  }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was upset because she wanted the room finished.
\par 
\par Fri  Not a lot happened at work today and not much for the weekend so I had an easy day. }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 came down with a wagon today so was here for 5pm so seeing as things were quiet I was home by 6pm. We had our teas then went to Asda for some shopping. We bumped into my cousin while we were there and she was telling }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{
\fs24\insrsid13964281  and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 some of the things we used to get up to when we were younger. Sat  Got up this morning and the weather was fine, my friend was in for coffee and a bit of crack. Brian was saying he has bought a house because the house he is in comes with the 
job but he is wanting to get out of farm work.  He says he has had enough of it and also he can't see much of a future in it.
\par Mam and Dad arrived when }{\fs24\insrsid11670163 [friend]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was there - Dad had fetched me the scaffolding because I want to paint the house.  The weather w
as dry but England were playing today so I couldn't make up my mind whether to paint the side of the house or watch the match.  The painting won so me and Dad set the scaffolding up and I got started.  }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 was giving me a running commentary on the game. 
 When the scaffolding was ready to move I came down but was too tempted. We had lunch and watched the last 20 minutes of the first half and about 15 minutes of the second half. England were 3-0 up that time so we though it was safe to go back out.  It sta
yed dry all afternoon so I got both coats on the wall and got it finished.  While I was doing that Dad and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 finished painting the garages. I've only one bit to do to the garages now and now I have the  scaffolding I can get it done.
\par 
\par Sunday  We got up this morning and went to Gretna market to get some new curtains.  When we came back me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 watched the Ireland game. They were so unlucky not to go through I felt sorry for them losing on penalties after playing so well.
\par After the match I thought about glossing the spouts on the back of the house or either paint the front of the house. The weather made my mind up for me for it pissed down so I had an easy afternoon instead.  I took }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{
\fs24\insrsid13964281  home about 7pm then just took it easy for the rest of the day.

\par I got a phone call tonight from the manager of a haulage company in Islay offering me a job so my head is in turmoil at the moment.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  away again today, yet another golf day. It's not too bad, livestock is very quiet.  Most of Cumbria is stocked up now so there isn't a lot of livestock to move and t
he fat markets are quiet as well. It's not bad though because the drivers and tractor units can do other jobs and we can get jobs done on the containers ready for what we call the back-end. The backend is when all the lamb sales are on and it starts somet
ime in July and can go through to March or April.
\par 
\par Thursday
\par It was a little bit busier at work today but not too busy. There were 5 wagons out today.  Dad fetched the caravan through tonight because we decided to go to the Highland show for the week-end.  D
ad just met me at work at 7 pm so I washed the Land rover and the caravan before going home.  I am borrowing Dad's Land rover as well because our car hasn't got a tow bar on it.  Dad is using our car for the weekend.  I just hope the weather is better tha
n it has been of late.  We put all we need into the caravan tonight so that we can go as soon as I finish work tomorrow night.
\par 
\par Fri
\par Spent most of the day out in the yard at work today moving Trailers and parking them properly so that when al the wagons star
t coming in their will be plenty of room for them.  Things were quiet this afternoon so I got finished about 5 pm. I had a shower and a quick cup of coffee, hitched the caravan on and set off for Edinburgh.  We got there just after 5pm, set the caravan up
 and went for something to eat.  It was great in the caravan, so peaceful, no hassle, no phones ringing.  It was good just to relax.
\par 
\par Sat
\par Went to the show about 10 am this morning.  When we got to the gates somebody was giving 2 tickets away so we got in fo
r nothing.  We only got about 100 yds in the first 2 hours, we kept bumping into people we knew and hadn't seen for a long time.  In the afternoon we met up with Dugald and Fiona and their two little boys Callum and Jamie. Fiona used to be }{
\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 's flatmate. We had a good afternoon with them walking round the machinery. Farm machinery nowadays is getting bigger and more complicated.
\par We went later on and met up with another two of our friends from Islay.  }{\fs24\insrsid11670163 [one]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was working on one of the stands in the foo
d hall, she works for one of the distilleries on the island. We went into Edinburgh for a meal, then went back to the caravan.
\par 
\par Sun
\par Didn't get up as early as we intended but were still at the show by 11 am.  We went and watched the sheep shearing competiti
on/  They were good to watch plus we knew some of the men shearing.  The competition was good. We had a walk round and bought some things we had seen on Saturday and had liked and then came away about 5.30 pm.  I was ready for my bed by the time we got ba
ck but it had been a good week-end.  I enjoyed it.

customers tomorrow. The wagons are fairly quiet but we have two teams of men in the yard because we are extending it.  They are building a truck wash and concreting the rest so }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 was showing me what to do so I could keep them right if they had any problems.
\par We took the caravan back to Dad's tonight it was pouring down, me and dad got soaked. We took the caravan to the compound where dad keeps it then back to see my Mam before we came home. The Land rover is nice to drive but it was good to get back into my

\par Tuesday }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was away before I got into work this morning but it wasn't bad because I knew what was going on.  It makes a nice change knowing what is happening because }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{

\par Some of the lads at work are trying to take the mick because }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 is away. It's difficult because I have to work with them as well as being their boss.  I can't afford to let them take the mick because if they get away with it once they will try again
 so I try and find some sort of compromise.  So far this has worked with most of them but there is the odd one that goes too far then I have to let them know who is in charge but I don't like doing that.
\par Weds
\par Things are starting to get a little bit busier. Today the phone was fairly busy. I think anybody that hasn't restocked is thinking about it. The only trouble I have is there is nothing going south but plenty to come north.
\par They operated on }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 's Mam today.  They removed a stone which was blocking her kidney, it was an acidic stone normally they are calcium}{\fs24\insrsid11670163  s}{\fs24\insrsid13964281

Longtown fat day today. I haven't seen as many buyers round a sale ring in a long time.  Everybody is needing sheep so they are coming out of the woodwork.  Ewes were a good trade but lambs were a bit easier.  It was nice to see there was a b

\par }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  came home today, it was good to see her, I've missed her.  I think with her being away and not being there to comfort her made it worse.

\par I came home from work about 11 am.  The weather wasn't very good but I took a chance
 and painted the spouts and windows at the back of the house.  I only had to stop once for a shower of rain.  If I have to wait for the good weather I will never get it done.

's bike and took him to my brother's so he could play with his cousins. It was a nice day so I was gong to paint the front of the house when I had the ch
ance.  We were at my brother's that long it wasn't worth starting when we got back as I had to go to work at 4 pm to load a wagon.  I put a net over my blueberries and strawberries instead.  }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281

\par  I have run around like a blue arsed fly all day. Things are busy out in the yard so between them and running the wagons it's been hectic.

\par Fairly busy again today, there is a lot of cattle coming up fro the south but regulations are holding things up and putting a lot of expense on our haulage.  I d
idn't get home until 8pm tonight and  I am going back out at midnight to help one of the lads deliver a load of cattle.

\par  Early start this morning I had some cattle to deliver that came up through night then led some cattle into Longtown.  It was dinner time before I realised.
\par There was a cow and calf sale at Carlisle today so it was  8pm when they finished selling, yet another late night. It was 10 pm when I left Carlisle and not an official person in sight.  I can't see why the rules are so stric
t and nobody there to police them.
\par 
\par Fri
\par All I wanted to do today was to find a quiet corner and go to sleep but there wasn't much chance of that.  The headman from the road Haulage Association phoned today. DEFRA are changing all the regulations for transp
ortation.  They are coming up with a whole new set of rules, more paperwork, more hassle.  They always just spring these things on you. I can't see why they can't consult the people that count i.e. the people who do the job.  If they done that we could wo
rk out a reasonable workable system.  DEFRA and SEERAD have different rules which is sometimes confusing. Why can't they get together and one set of rules for the whole country instead of being pigheaded.
\par 
\par Sat
\par I went into work this morning.  I had to go and load a tipper because I couldn't find a driver to do it.  I got home about lunch time and it was a glorious sunny day so I set to and painted the front of the house.  I got it all done except the gloss.

\par 
\par Sun
\par When I got up this morning it was dry but not a
s good as yesterday so I just got on and glossed the front and got it finished.  I wanted it finished because I have to go and load a wagon tonight plus we are going on holiday next week-end. I am pleased 99% of the painting is finished because we can go 
away for two weeks instead of one.  We were just going to go for one and spend a week at home so we could get something done but we have got on well so we can go for two.  I am looking forward to my holiday. I am ready for it.

Today started bad and got worse.  Things were busy.  All the wagons were out working the first time since F&M broke out.  I got a phone call this morning from one of the drivers \endash  one of the brakes on the trailer had gone over the cam \endash 
 heated up and set on fire.  Luckily he had got to the farm and managed to get the sheep off.  The container is a bit of a mess and will be off the road for a few days, possibly weeks.  That\rquote s all I ne
ed at the busy time of year.  We were talking about it afterwards and it came up, what if the livestock were moving by licence and something like that happened and you were 20 mile off your destination.  Of course on the driver\rquote 
s side of things common sens
e would prevail and he would let the livestock off in the nearest field.  Then would DEFRA allow them to be taken to their destination right away or would they make them stay for 21 days.  Everybody thought the same.  DEFRA have no common sense or concern
s of animal welfare and would make them stay for 21 days.

It was Lairg sale today. Lairg is in Caithness and is normally the biggest store lamb sale in the country.  Normally there is between 30 000 and 35 000 lambs sold in one day.  Anyone to do with
 farming or sheep has heard of Lairg.  This year there was only 12 000 sheep sold which shows the decline and loss of interest in farming.  It seems sad to think that products can be imported into the country cheaper from abroad than it can be provided in
 our own country.
\par Things were going quite well today unto about teatime, one of the wagons came home after delivering a load of cattle at a local farm.  When the driver set off after putting fuel in, the pin on the trailer snapped off.  I wan now 2 containe

m going to do it.  Because of the travelling time between the two countries, the journey time is too long.  You are allowed 14 hours, I hour\rquote 
s rest, then another 14 hours.  Then the livestock has to be taken off and rested for  24 hours before it can continue its journey.  If a time runs out whi
le on a ferry it only has to be rested for 12 hours.  Because these are in calf heifers, it would be better for them to do the whole journey in one go but it will still be difficult to organise.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 I got a phone call today from an auctioneer in Irel
and.  He had got a load of cattle for one of his customers near Bristol.  The cattle travelled up 3 week ago but when they arrived at Larne the Irish Authorities found a mistake on the paperwork and put the wagon straight back on the boat.  The cattle hav
e been on a farm at Stranraer for two week and he was wanting to know if we could take them back to Bristol for him.  The cattle can\rquote t move for another week because DEFRA put a 21 day movement order on them and they can\rquote 
t go to Ireland.  They have to go back to the farm of origin which is the farm they came off, go through all the tests again, then stay there for 30 days after the tests, before they can be exported again.  With all that the man in Ireland doesn\rquote 
t want the cattle now.  I can\rquote t see why they couldn\rquote t sort the paperwork  out at Stranraer and let the cattle go to Ireland. , instead of trailing them all over the country for 2 month, where\rquote s the animal welfare?

\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid13964281 Friday
\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 I phoned DEFRA today to see if we could move the cows from Stranraer on welfare grounds as they are dairy cattle and one of them has calved.  I was told the cattle can\rquote 
t move until next Friday night at midnight.  When DEFRA introduced the interim measures, animal welfare went out of the window.
\par 
\par I wonder quite a lot if Animal Rights k
new about the rules Defra have imposed what their reaction would be.  They give us a lot of abuse about the way animals are transported but over the last 18 month they have been very quiet.  I just wonder if they  knew about something like these dairy cow
s and how much we try our best for the animals, would they be as hard on DEFRA and SEERAD as they are on us?

 must move within 30 days of calving or 30 days after calving so to put the job off for a week will put the cattle within 30 days of calving.  I will now have to start again and find a haulier who can do the job within the next 2 weeks.  I phoned all the

Longtown was very busy again today.  Vehicles queued on the road right into town.  The only good thing, DEFRA were there to see it for themselves today.  There was a meeting between Longtown mart and DEFRA on Monday to try and get some
 of the restrictions lifted.  They were trying to get them to allow them to use the land rover unloading bay again.  DEFRA in Carlisle couldn't give them a decision.  The answer came from two officials in Page St in London.  What a waste of time.  Two peo
p
le who probably don't know even know where Longtown is, never mind how the market works, making decisions how the market should run.  It's about time these people in Page St got out of London and into the real world.  In the south a big sale is 2 000 head
 of stock, Longtown alone had 9 and a half thousand and Hexham had 8 000.  They can't see sales like this work different to small sales.

\par Things are very busy in the UK as well, there is a lot of livestock moving but it se
ems to be getting harder. DEFRA have now started following up licences and movements, they were on the phone 3 times today. They are pests when you get them on the phone because you can't get rid of them. But as you would expect they get somebody else to 
do the dirty work for them.  They get Trading standards to follow everything up for them.

\par Tuesday
\par Had an early start this morning both me and }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  were out on wagons this morning.  I was at Lockerbie for 7.30am for a load of sheep into Longtown and }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was lead
ing cattle into Carlisle.  When I got back I was sooner than }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  so I took the phones and started arranging work for today.  }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 got back about 11am and I sent him back out to move some more cattle.  About 2 pm things were getting very busy, the phones wouldn't stop ringing.  I'd just sent }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 to Carlisle to fetch some cattle back.  He was just ready for leaving when I got the phone call I had always dreaded. One of the drivers had tipped a loaded wagon onto its side. It took me a while to get the driver calmed d
own and get any sense out of him.  First thing was to make sure he was all right, then find out where he was.  I caught }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 before he got out of the yard so he jumped in his car with one of our mechanics and took off up the road to him.  This meant I was lef
t with everything to do myself.  The rest of the drivers were very good. They just mucked in, helped with other things so  I could get on.  I was still organising tomorrow's work when }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 got back about 9pm so we set to together and got it sorted. I got finished about 11.30, I didn't need rocking to sleep.
\par 
\par It was one of the busies days we have had, the phones just wouldn't stop ringing. About 6 30 pm I could have could have just walked out and come home.  I still don't know what stopped me from doing it.  I'
ve never felt that way about my job before, I think I'm just sick of the hassle and the rules and regulations.
\par 
\par Wednesday
\par Things starter quieter this morning thank goodness because we didn't have a wagon left in the yard.  By lunch time it was a different 
story, the phones were as bad as ever. It wasn't just as bad because there was 2 of us answering them.  We spent a lot of time finding subcontractors to work for us because we didn't have enough wagons of our own.  I think with the spell of bad weather we
 have had a lot of farmers are getting rid of fat lambs before they damage the ground.  They are appearing from everywhere.  I was hoping for an early finish but I didn't get finished until 9pm.  
\par 
\par Thursday
\par Longtown today but things have quietened down a bit, it wasn't as busy.  There was plenty of sheep about but not a great deal of interest. The abattoirs are full of wet sheep that the vets won't let them kill so they have no room for anymore.
\par 
\par We have started to get sponsors for our karting challenge. Five of us are doing a 2 and a half hour endurance on karts in aid of }{\fs24\insrsid16677158 Marie Curie}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 cancer care. Last year we got to the final at Manchester because we raised the most money in the North of England.  We raised \'a32 700 last year so we are going to try and beat it this year. We need to get on because the race is a week on Sunday.
\par 
\par Friday
\par Not just as busy today so when we had the chance we got caught up on invoices and paperwork. It took nearly all day but we got there eventually.  We got a few more sponsors today so at least we've got a start.
\par 
\par Saturday
\par Started to rub the doors down in the front bedroom today. I managed to get the first two coats of varnish on them while }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  washed the skirting boards and painted them.  Between }{\fs24\insrsid11670163 
[friends]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  and dad coming in, it took us all day to get that done.  We had our tea and just relaxed the rest of the night.
\par 
\par Sunday
\par We got woken at 07.00 this morning with the water pipes banging.  With taking the radiator off to paint it, the water wasn't circulating and it boiled and we had
 to run the taps for 20 minutes before it cooled down. Later on I went to Homebase for filler and paint for the radiator.  As soon as I got back I painted the radiator so we could get it back on and the water circulating again.  While I was doing that, }{
\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 was rubbing the doors down again to put another coat of varnish on.  I emulsioned the ceiling while she done that, then put another coat of varnish on the door.  We got cleaned up so now the room is ready for the decorator to come and paper it.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 Out on a wagon most of the day today, some of the day in Scotland and some of the day in England. With working with 2 sets of rules it gets confusing. Do you need a licence or don't you?  Can you do more than one delivery?  In Scot
land the only time you need a licence is for farm to farm movements.  In England all movements need a licence. We get a lot of phone calls from farmers in England who have bought sheep in a Scottish market wanting to know where their paperwork is. So we h
ave to explain to them that you don't need paperwork out of a Scottish market unless the sheep are going to an abattoir.

 down it makes things a bit more difficult. I had an odd spare minute or two today.  So I was on the phone getting sponsors for our karting challenge.  Two of the lads in our team drive at night and don't get to see many people so I am trying to fill thei

ut for Monday.  I had some sheep to deliver into Carlisle abattoir after 12.00 because DEFRA say they can only stay in an abattoir 48 hours before  they are killed, I can't take them in any sooner.  It's crazy, the abattoir has straw pens, food and water.
 
 I know they are going there to be killed but it is more humane on the animal to be comfortable in a straw pen than standing in a market or on a wagon.  With all these rules about F&M, the animal welfare has been lost somewhere along the line. It's time D
EFRA listened to trading standards, farmers, hauliers, markets, basically the people who count.  I didn't get finished until 3.30 pm, longer than what I thought.

d
ing standards that he was driving the wagon.  After he had gone I phoned our driver to tell him he was just going to get a warning and just agree with him.  I don't blame him for denying it, I think it's a shame that you can get prosecuted for doing your

\rquote t believe how strict the rules were with us in England.  In Scotland the only thing they can\rquote t do is buy stock in one market then take them to another to sell them again.  Because of the 21 day rule, they have to either tak
e them home for 21 days or send them direct to an abattoir.  I\rquote ve never seen an MLC official all day.  I loaded 7 wagons but I didn\rquote t need to get 1 licence. In Scotland all movements are recorded by computer.

Back to English rules today in Longtown back to MLC watching you & DEFRA watching them.  Why can Scotland be so advanced and record all movements out of the markets on computer but England can\rquote 
t.  In England you must take a licence before you leave the market but at the same time everything that comes into the market passes through the  market, then leaves the market \endash 
 has to be emailed to DEFRA by the market the day after the sale.  If we could move Longtown market 2 mile north it would save a lot of bother we wouldn\rquote t have half the hassle we have now.

This week is going to be busy leading up to Xmas, it always is.  The phones have been going crazy.  As well as the fat sales a lot of farmers who have bought livestock want it home for Christmas.  Because of the rules it makes it a little more difficult w
hen you have a lot of stock to shift.  A lot of the abattoirs now because you can come home to wash out have done away wit their washing facilities.  This makes it very difficult when you are fetching a load back out of the South.

\par Things were busy today.  We run out of wagons and drivers fast.  One of the biggest jobs we had today was working out which wagons would be back early enough for tomorrow\rquote s work but we eventually got it sorted out.
\par Just as we were getting ready to go home, an ambulance pulled into the yard.  We hadn\rquote

 to go home but the ambulance people wouldn\rquote t let him \endash  they took him to hospital.

 small wagons had lifted some cattle on a farm and when he was heading for Carlisle he came towards Westlinton Crossroads and didn\rquote

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 Back to the grind this morning.  I could have stopped in bed this morning although it was a good relaxing week-end, it was hectic.  }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 had decide to sell the continental containers and stop going abroad with livestock.  There is too much hassle involved organising loads abroad and since }{\fs24\insrsid484382 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 has gone, there is nobody really interested in going abroad.
\par 
\par Tuesday
\par Things 
are very busy but it seems to be the middle of the week.  Because of the regulations and the time livestock can be kept after it has been sold, abattoirs do most of the killing in the middle of the week.  There are 2 types of sales in England, one week is
 
a store sale and the next week is a designated slaughter sale.  If you buy stock in a store sale you can take it home and send it to an abattoir or you can take it home for a week then send it direct to an abattoir and does not affect your 21 days that yo
u
 are meant to keep them.  A designated slaughter day means the livestock has to go direct to the abattoir.  If a farmer bought livestock last week, nothing is allowed on or off his land for 21 days but on a designated slaughter day he can still sell his f
a
t stock even if he bought stock last week.  So he could sell fat stock today even if he bought stock last week.  When the stock gets to the abattoir it must be killed within 48 hours. So with most sales being mid week most of the abattoirs have to fill th
eir orders when they can which is the middle of the week when the livestock is available. 
\par 
\par Weds
\par Things are very busy today \endash  there is a lot of livestock about.  The Pakistani abattoirs are stocking up taking sheep to local farms to keep for over Christmas because of their religion they don\rquote 
t celebrate the same as we do.  They are keeping us busy because we are doing some of next week\rquote s work this week.
\par 
\par Thursday
\par Early start this morning leading sheep into Longtown.  We have to make sure we count the sheep ex
actly right.  DEFRA now are clamping down on numbers that are put on the licence.  If you load sheep on a farm for example if you go for 150 and you load them out of a corner of a field it\rquote 
s nearly impossible to get a correct count. You might 149 but when 
you get to the market where you can count them properly and there is 148 but you have written 149 on the licence, DEFRA want to know where the other sheep is.  You are not allowed to be human, you can\rquote t make a mistake, you\rquote 
ve got to be the same as DEFRA and live in a perfect world where mistakes don\rquote t happen.  I would like to see some of these people in a field counting sheep because I don\rquote 
t think they would know where to start.  They expect every farm to have pens and runs and loading banks for sheep.  Real life doesn\rquote t work that way.  Normal people don\rquote 
t have the money.  The Government does so they have to make do with what they have got and what they can afford.

.  They were told by Defra that he papers had already been signed so it would have to happen.  They said that they knew it wouldn\rquote

\par The new rules were announced in the farming papers today.  The 20 day rule has been 
replaced by a six day rule.  This is good.  It will help the job a lot.  The other thing is they say they are going to put a vet in every market and any livestock sold through a market can only travel 150 km.  If they get that rule in, there will be no li

nes were busy today, people asking what the new rules are and when they are coming in and how they will affect them.  The rules that are coming into place, instead of of 20 day standstill if you stock onto your farm, they are going to reduce it to 6 days.
  That\rquote 
s the good part.  The bad part is that markets will have to make sure everything is washed before leaving the market.  They are also talking about anything bought in a market will be only allowed to travel 150km/94 mile.  If they make this rule stick
 the agriculture industry is finished.

\par We are busy today \endash  middle of the week always is busy now with everything having to be killed within 48 hours so most of the abattoirs want everything in the middle of the week.  For meat to flavour properly it 
should be hung for at least a week but these days it\rquote s packaged the next day, ready for the shelf, then delivered to supermarkets within two days.  That\rquote s the time they give it t mature.  So if you buy sheep on a Wednesday, it\rquote 
s killed on a Thursday, packed on a Friday, in the shops on a Monday. This is where Defra doesn\rquote t understand, they think it\rquote s bought and in the supermarket the same day.

think is working best, will be put
 in place and stay in place.  All M.L.C. staff who look after the washing out at markets are finished at the end of February and it will be up to the markets to police the cleansing of vehicles.  If a dirty vehicle turns up with livestock to sell, it will
 
have to be turned away at the entrance (still with stock on).  The public car park also has to be policed the same way. In August the 150 km out of markets is coming in, the government say because there are no fat markets in Europe and stock is traded on 
the farm.  Britain has to come in line with the rest of Europe. If yu go to Greece or Spain on holiday, you can see full carcasses hanging outside of a butcher\rquote

\par Back in the office this morning, things are
 busy for the time of year.  We wonder sometimes where all the livestock is coming from.  Prices are very god just now so its encouraging people to sell stock rather than keep hold of it until prices get better.  It\rquote 
s a good sign that prices are good becau
se a lot of farmers were just trying with about 60% of the stock pre F&M to se how things were going to do so with things being good and going well it will encourage them to stock back 100% rather than go down the way.

\par I was leading sheep into Longtown today. It\rquote 
s the first sale under the new rules.  What a nightmare.  The whole place was at a standstill.  After you have emptied your sheep off you have to wash the wheels at the wash then drive over another wheel wash but you can still come out of 
the auction without washing the container out.  The muck inside the container must not be able to carry the disease!

\par I finished early tonight because it\rquote s the annual cow punchers ball.  This is the nickname it has been given over the years.  It\rquote 
s right title is Animal Road Haulage Association Northern Division Annual Dinner Dance.  So you can understand why it\rquote s been shortened to the cowp
unchers.  Apart from the band it was a good night.  I seen a lot of faces I only see at that dance, hauliers from Yorkshire and Lancashire.  I speak to them often enough on the phone but it\rquote 
s nice to put a face to the voice and have a natter with them.

\par We didn\rquote t do a lot today.  We didn\rquote t get up very early and when we did, }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 \rquote 
s back was aching a bit with sitting so long last night.  She is getting quite big now so she gets a bit uncomfortable.  I sat and watched the rugby this afternoon and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 had 40 winks on the couch.  It was nice to see her chilling out because normally she never stops.

\par The decorator finally came this morning but not to start.  He is coming on Tuesday night.  He is going to do it at night after work so we can get it
 finished and back to normal before the baby arrives.  I gave all the bits that needed it another coat of gloss this afternoon and so everything is ready for him coming now.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 Early start this morning we have a driver away on a hazardous goods cours

u
st did what I had to do and came home.  I think also getting out and seeing the countryside and different things rather than sitting looking at a computer screen and 4 walls.  When I am in the office I look out of the window and see the same things every 
time.  When I\rquote m out on a wagon I see something different all the time.

\par Tuesday
\par I took a load of sheep into Longtown this morning, then went to Silloth for a load of ferty (fertiliser).  We are doing quite a lot of ferty now because the livestock is quieting off a little bit.  It\rquote 
s still amazing just how busy the livestock is for the time of year and considering the amount of livestock that was killed through F&M.
\par Ian the Decorator phoned this afternoon because he is having to work late.  I am beginning to think he will never get this kitchen decorated.

\par I was delivering sheep around the Penrith area today to various farms.  I enjoyed that going to farms and talking to the farmers  Most of them are optimistic about the future the way things are at the mo

\par I got a shock when I got home.  Ian had actually turned up and started to decorate the kitchen.  Ian went home about 8pm and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 started to make the tea.  While she was making the tea, her waters started to leak.  }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  phoned the hospital and had to take her I to get checked because she still has 6 weeks to go.  When we got to the h
ospital }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was checked over but they couldn\rquote t say whether all her waters had gone or just some but whatever the baby could be 2 to 3 weeks early.  }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{
\fs24\insrsid13964281  had an injection to help the baby\rquote s lungs develop faster because she was going to give birth earlier than what she should.  }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 had to stay in hospital for the night so they could keep an eye on her and to give her the second part of the injection in the morning.

\par I got a phone call at 7am to say that they thought }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  was going into labour.  When I got to the hospital }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [wife]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
 was having contractions.  At 12.12 pm we had a little girl 6 weeks early.  She was quite a good weight for being early 4lb 14 oz but very small.  She was take away to the special care baby unit.  When we got to see he
r she was on oxygen and pipes and monitors all around her.  We were told not to worry it was all precaution because she was early and with no explanation.  It\rquote s hard not to worry when you see all them pipes and machines.

\par When I got  to the hospital about 7/30pm }{\fs24\insrsid16677158 [new baby]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  had pulled all her tubes out.  The nurses couldn\rquote

\par Me and }{\fs24\insrsid4859116 [son]}{\fs24\insrsid13964281  set
 to today to clean my garage out.  We took everything out of the garage then I stayed to clean it out.  I got a full van load of old wood out.  We took that down to work and put it on the fire.  When we came back I started to bag the rubbish up.
\par 
\par Thursday
\par Mam and Dad came through today. Dad came to help me in the garage.  I already had the van full of rubbish.  We emptied the racking and moved it so that I could add some more to it.  With the rubbish off the racking we filled Dad's trailer.  Once we had go

\par I was out on a wagon today I was leading sheep into Longtown.  I enjoy it more on a wagon these days.  I\rquote m out of the way and can\rquote t see what is going on.  When I\rquote m in the office I feel like I\rquote 
m achieving something.  With the company growing as big it\rquote s not just a family firm anymore.  You can\rquote t get the same conversation out of the bosses as you used to. 
\par 
\par Weds
\par I was out on a wagon again this morning and I was supposed to go to Cockermouth this afternoon but sheep were too expensive so our customer didn\rquote t buy any.  There are still quite
 a few sheep about and a good demand for them so things are quite good just now.  Normally at this time of the year things are not so busy.
\par 
\par Thursday
\par There was quite a few Irish sheep in Longtown today.  Their retention period is off so a lot of the Irish 
farmers are off loading sheep when they are a good price.  The retention period is for the subsidies.  A farmer applies to the government for subsistence for keeping ewes and ewe lambs.  A farmer will apply for let\rquote 
s say 200 sheep and depending where he is it can vary  from \'a312 to \'a3
17 per female sheep.  So a lot of farmers keep hold of their old ewes ad the ewe lambs that are not really any good for breeding.  Some buy old ewes in just for their numbers.  When they apply for sub there is a period of time wh
en they have to keep that number of sheep.  In both GB and Ireland the forms have to be in by January and that number of sheep has to be kept.  Government officials can go to the farm and count at any time.  In GB this period of time (the retention period
)
 ends in the middle of May but in Ireland it ends in the middle of April.  This favours the Irish because British farmers are still keeping hold of their sheep and numbers in markets are less.  The Irish fetch their sheep over here and get good prices for
 them.
\par 
\par Friday
\par There wasn\rquote t a lot happening today with it being Good Friday and the Easter week-end.  Things weren\rquote t very busy.  I hope it stays that way because }{\fs24\insrsid11086707 D}{\fs24\insrsid13964281

 to play with his cousins this morning.  Just out of Longtown both local farms had their dairy cows out on grass.  It was strange but really good to see it\rquote s the first time I\rquote ve seen cows in fields around Longtown for the last two year. 

\par 
\par Saturday
\par There was a meeting at work this morning about wages and holidays with the new working 
time directive coming in to place in August.  There was a lot of unhappy people came out of that meeting not because of the W.T.D. but about the way As were handling it and the way they were treating their workers.  Could be some fun this week or two.

\par We\rquote re not so busy today but Longtown is busy.  I didn\rquote t have to take any sheep in this morning because we had plenty of drivers about.  Today prices were very good.  This sort of trade couldn\rquote 
t last though it would be nice if it could but abattoirs can\rquote t stand paying these prices for too long.  The supermarkets are still paying the same price for the meat from abattoirs so abattoirs can\rquote

Things are a bit busier again today with the end of the retention period last week. There is more sheep about. There was a ewe and lamb sale at Penrith today, which made things busier. We ended up with three loads of 
sheep out there. I sent one lad to Penrith for a load of sheep to come to a farm in Penton. The first I knew I got a phone call from the farmer wanting to know why there was a wagon in his yard looking for a load of sheep to go to Penrith. Its no wonder I
 have to work to 11 p.m. at night. At least the farmer had seen the funny side of it!

Things are fairly quiet with it being dry and the weather quite good. A lot of farmers are taking advantage of the weather and cutting grass for silage. The 
sheep trade is back quite a bit so people are hanging on to what sheep they have left to see if the trade lifts.
\par We had one of our wagons stopped today at a checkpoint near Chester. There was a DEFRA official and he reported the driver doing more than 1 pi

\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid13964281 Week 71
\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 After our meeting I have decided that my last diary will cover some of the things talked about.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\insrsid13964281 (Researcher\rquote s note \endash  D is referring to a focus group meeting with some of the other project respondents and the research team who discussed the project\rquote 
s interim findings. These findings were presented under four main themes. D reflects on these below)
\par }{\fs24\insrsid13964281 
\par Knowledge
\par What has been learned from F&M?  I think if it wasn\rquote t for the high compensation levels, there would have been a civil war in this country due to Defra\rquote 
s incompetence. I also think the way the agriculture community stood together and helped one another in this crisis and afterwards was amazing.  I think we\rquote ve all learned not to trust Defra and if they had listened to local knowledge things wouldn
\rquote t have been as bad as they were.  The knowledge of livestock and agriculture in Cumbiria is immense.  That\rquote s why people travel from al over the country to buy livestock at renowned places like Lazonby. Th
is knowledge is passed down generations \endash  it\rquote s not learned by somebody coming from nowhere into an office and reading a text book.
\par 
\par Trauma
\par From my own experience the trauma of getting up in a morning to a smoke filled house, travelling 30 miles to work pas
t pyres burning and no livestock in the fields, knowing your livelihood depends on the animals being there.  Farmers and friends crying down the phone to you and others shouting down the phone to you. Page Street didn\rquote 
t understand a lot of the trauma because to understand it you have to live it, experience it and see it. I don\rquote 
t think any one outside of F&M areas just understood what it was like to watch your livelihood and part of your life disappearing in front of your eyes knowing there\rquote s nothing you can do about it. Especially when somebody from London who doesn
\rquote t understand and is controlling a lot of it.  I think as for the trauma I think the trauma caused  at the time and after will never go away.  I know there\rquote s a lot I will never forget.
\par 
\par Lifescapes
\par Lifescape as far as work goes, the whole way we organise and do our job has changed.  We have accepted things had to change but the way it has been done and handled could be a lot better.
\par At home I\rquote ve lost a good friend but later on I gained a daughter and I am in the process of making a new life for me and my family.
\par Throughout F&M and after the one thing that I always thought was that no matter what happens we don\rquote t know what the future holds but \'93life goes on.\'94
\par 
\par Recovery
\par Recovery will take a long time, some things and places will never recover.  We all know things will never be the same.  I don\rquote 
t know about anywhere else but in Cumbria the resistance and will to survive is strong.  As long as government will allow it, Cumbria will rover and with the lessons that have been learned I think it will be better than it ever was.
\par 
\par Governance
\par Looking back at the mess officials made of trying to contain F&M and the way they ignored local knowledge, the so called experts in high positioned jobs.  If, and I hope it doesn\rquote t happen again, will things be any different \endash  I honestly don
\rquote t think so. Most people learn by their mistakes. Will they or will they just try and blame somebody else again?  I don\rquote t think it will happen but Defra, London, or where ever, will have to
 trust local knowledge and locals will have to trust Defra or whoever is in charge. The reason I don\rquote 
t think it will happen because after all that has happened over the last two years, all trust has gone.  A lot of the bother was caused because officials from away didn\rquote t trust anybody.
\par 
\par 
\par Well that is my view. I\rquote ve enjoyed writing the diaries. I suppose some days it was a stress buster writing about the rules, regulations and idiots in Defra.
\par Mine is just one voice and one opinion and probably wouldn\rquote t be heard on its own.  I hope my diaries have been a help and that combined with everybody else\rquote 
s diaries, you can make a big voice that can and will be heard. There is probably a lot more I could write but I think I\rquote ve covered most of the important things
