 I had seen on the local news last night there is an exhibition of artwork on in Kendal that interested me, so I went with a friend to look and bought 3 pictures which I really liked.  Had a look round Kendal then came home and the Travel Agents phoned to
 say the holiday I had booked had fallen through., and it would cost another \'a3
250 for a similar holiday in a poorer hotel.  I went mad at them as they have messed us about and were totally unapologetic, and told them to shove the holiday.  Told the rest of 
the boys and they said to pay the extra or we wouldn't get a holiday at all.  One of the lads phones to do that as I didn't want to talk to the travel agents again as they had really got my back up.

agging system.  Once he had done that I spent the rest of the day swapping over old tags for new ones.  At home I just tidied up a bit and read for the rest of the night.
\par Friday I continued swapping tags over, then a friend who used to live in the village but moved to Birmingham came to visit.  After work he came to my house and we got drunk and went to the pub, there was a good crowd out, a good night.
\par Saturday I tidied up a bit, watched football results then went to a party in Carlisle at a friends house.  Lots of students and some very pretty Spanish girls.  Got drunk and had a good night.
\par Sunday woke up on sofa, breakfast was the buffet leftovers, then went to se my website designer (who is a good friend) sorted a few things out then came home to watch M
an Utd win 2-0.  Hooray!!  An antique dealer friend came round at night and we listened to music and talked for hours.

\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid5768108 Monday 4th February
\par }{\fs24\insrsid5768108 Monday, Mum and Dad have gone to visit friends in Scotland and left me to look after the dog. Quite busy at work, its half term in Yorkshire this week so could be all right. Just stayed in except for a couple of walks with the dog.

\par Tuesday, had a good day at work, just on my own but quite busy. I enjoy being busy. Finished work and flew home to get dog out for a long walk before dark. Had a few friends round for pancakes. Ate loads. Good night.
\par Wednesday, another good day at work on my own, good crowd of customers. Friendly and a good laugh. Took dog for another long walk then watched England match with friends. Good 
match. Showed promise. Mum and Dad are back and took the dog home, then went to a friends to play on a new }{\fs24\insrsid7620127 Playstation}{\fs24\insrsid5768108  2 game. Excellent. I'll have to save up for a }{\fs24\insrsid7620127 Playstation}{
\fs24\insrsid5768108  2.
\par Thursday, woke up full of cold with a streaming nose. Another busy day at wo
rk but I wasn't as enthusiastic as the last few days. Customers were very kind and patient with me though, as I kept running off to blow my nose. Went home and just stayed in watching T.V by the fire, and blowing my nose a lot.
\par Friday, woke up feeling much better, the sun was shining. It was yesterday as}{\fs24\insrsid14955911  }{\fs24\insrsid5768108 
well. It's lovely to get a nice fresh day after all the rain and wind. Busy at work, had to stay back to put new stock on computer. Got home late, had tea then went to pup.
\par Saturday, wasn't as busy as I excepted, so I got all my paperwork up to date. Went to a friends housewarming after work, they have just moved into the same village as me so it's good to have more friends in the parish.
\par Sunday, had a brilliant long lye in, went to the pub for lunch, came home to watch football then back to pub. Met up with a friend and went to her house with some famous people. Got drunk and had a really good night.

\par }{\fs24\insrsid5768108 Monday, hung over at work, didn't really do anything, came home and didn't move off the sofa.
\par Tuesday, very quiet at work, it's half term and we should be busy, went to Safeway after work and bought a huge steak. I hardly ever cook so this was quite an event. Had my tea and just watched telly for the rest of the night.
\par Wednesday, another qu
iet day. It's worse when you think your going to be busy and your all geared up for action, but the day never really gets going. Makes the days drag. Watched the football, one all draw, not too bad. I've got tickets for the home match next week. Should be
 good. Went to the pub for one after the match then home to bed.
\par Thursday, started to organise things for while I'm on holiday. Put in a few orders for top ups from some suppliers, so they turn up and I can get them on the computer and out on the shop floor
. Trying to organise it so nothing turns up while I'm away. Went to trade show at Skelwith Bridge with Dad. Saw a few things that will be good for next Autumn/winter. Stopped at the Queens at Troutbeck for supper on the way back. Had a really nice meal th
en came home, watched Kylie on telly, what a fine creature she is. Went to pub.
\par Friday, I started going through my forward orders that are due in March. I reduced the quantities on a few where it looked like we had too much coming in, and changed the delive
ry date so that nothing should come whilst I'm away. Went to the pub and it started snowing. Had a good night and a brilliant snowball fight on the way home.
\par Saturday, morning, opened the curtains, snow everywhere. About 10 through the night. The road to w
ork was blocked, so went to the golf course to snowboard, but not steep enough. Drove around and found a good hill. Boarding all afternoon, then went to pick Dad up from work. He had walked there with the dog, but had a very quiet day. Went to the pub lat
er on, had a good crack then another snowball fight. Ace.
\par Sunday went to a trade show in Manchester, saw some friends I hardly ever see and had a good day looking at stuff for next Autumn/winter. Got home about tea time and some friends came round, had a dr
ink and played cards, I lost, then went to the pub for last orders. Snow not good for snowballs anymore, but the road is all ice, made some good slides down the hill. Fell over loads.

 Easter, but it's still very quiet. Kids break up for a fortnight today though. Went out in town tonight for a males birthday. Got really pissed and nearly arrested for pissing in the street. I really shouldn't drink tequila.
\par Saturday, went to the accounts to get my book's and disks back, then went to work and spent an hour on the phone with the accountant talking me through doing the VAT. Came home and just stopped in.

just laughed when I told him on Saturday. He's been sulking all day and I've got loads of work to do but he's being pathetic. Busy with customers, should be buzzing but Dads doing my head in.
\par Wednesday, told Dad to stop being pathetic. My personal life is 
nothing to do with him. Busy with customers, stock turning up, I'm knackered but the work has to be done. If I'm working all the time like this I need to blow out now and again. Stayed back till 10 rearranging the shop and trying to get all the new stuff

I think if you take something away from people (being aloud to walk in the fells) then they want it more than usual and even people that never used to go walking are interested, probably because of al the media coverage.  People have been asking us all ye
ar if we got over F&M and how this year compares. F&M has definitely raised people\rquote s awareness of the countryside and hopefully will make people more respectful of country ways.  We have had our best year ever, but I hope it\rquote 
s not a one off.  I know people 
forget very quickly but if the people that got into walking this year enjoyed themselves, then hopefully it will cause more people to try fell walking and in turn bring more people into the Lake District.  Obviously I have selfish reasons for this (I want
 
the shop to get busier and better) but for the whole rural economy to be blossoming is good for the whole country.  And the more money is generated in rural areas, the more the Government has to realise there is life outside the M25 and actually listen to
 what is needed and will work for the countryside rather than coming up with outlandish schemes based on their own experts\rquote  findings and opinions.  This Gov\rquote t really is an urban government, bringing in schemes that don\rquote 
t take country life into account and aren\rquote t implement}{\insrsid2064346 a}{\insrsid5768108 
ble in rural areas.  Taxing petrol sky high but not improving public transport as an alternative to your own car is a fine example. If anything good can come from F&M, raised awareness that country life is very different from town life and 
what works for one will not work for the other, would be a step forward.

t cook and have never been interested before, but I think getting another room in my house to look really smart is brilliant.  Went to town and met mum and Dad at the accounts to go over our year end figures.  Our best year ever, the accountant says I
\rquote ve done brilliantly last year.  Went to Safeways then home and stayed in.

\par  Alive again!!  Had a good early start and a full day on the slopes. The only problem with this place is the bloody button lifts.  I just can\rquote t do them.  The piste is high and perfect.  Weather couldn\rquote t be better, sunny

\par Taking over the shop at }{\fs24\insrsid2064346 P}{\fs24\insrsid5768108  is really exciting.  I think I can turn that into a little gold mine. It\rquote s the perfect location and I\rquote 
m sure doing more walking gear and fashion will do far bet than chandlery is, I think I\rquote m going to be quite a wealthy boy in a few years.

\par Where work is getting better and better so is my private life. I have so much fun on evenings and my days off
 with my mates.  We have a riot all the time. Doing stupid things and having adventures.  Not having a girlfriend really is a license to have fun.  No ear bending and whingeing.  Life is good.
